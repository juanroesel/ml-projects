Over a month ago , the experienced Iraqi politician Adnan Pachachi doubted Prime Minister Nouri Al - Malaki 's ability to carry out his promise to disband the armed militias and disarm them and said that Al - Maliki was in one corner and his government ministers , whether Shiites from the Al - Sadr movement and Al - Hakim 's group or Sunnis , were in another corner in terms of their allegiance to parties that have armed militias .
In fact , Pachachi 's conclusions are nothing new for the Iraqi situation that has reached the edge of a bottomless pit because of these militias whose existence the Iraqi man on the street can no longer tolerate as they have turned his life into a hell worse than the fire of Saddam 's Fedayeen and the bloody Hunin apparatus during the first chapter of dictatorship in the land of Mesopotamia .
And while Al - Maliki reached a new level of confrontation in his attack in parliament a few days ago when he denounced those he called " politicians during the day and pro-Saddam militias and terrorists at night , " Diri Al - Sadri who escaped an American raid to capture him is still active , and openly so , in his stronghold in Al - Sadr city some of whose residents boasted in a statement reported by the London newspaper Al - Hayat of what they called Abu Diri 's relations with officials who visit in order to get close to him .
Ali Al - Bideri said with pride , " Our area has become notorious and is being constantly visited by senior state officials who seek Abu Diri 's approval and pledge their obedience .
This has made people flock to his house in search of his mediation with them to empoy their unemployed children . "
These visits , according to this proud citizen , Al - Bideri " are not just by Iraqi state officials but also by foreigners from an Islamic state " which is , of course , Iran .

We are watching activity in Baghdad .
While we do , we want to tell you Marines battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of Nasiriyah face stiff resistance from Iraqi paramilitary groups today .
For some perspective , let 's turn to Miles O'Brien with retired Air Force General Don Shepperd .
Thank you very much .
If you are going to fight on the ground , you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way .
A lot of bridges between where the 3 7 Cavalry and the rest of the U.S. forces are now and their ultimate destination , downtown Baghdad .
We have the city laid out for you here .
How many bridges in this city alone ?
In this map we have right here , 13 major bridges in downtown Baghdad , including the expressway bridge over here .
Three bridges here attaching East Baghdad to West Baghdad and the palace area .
This is one technique , one possible way U.S. forces might seize a bridge , a bridge that might be defended by Iraqis .
Let 's look at the animation .
Typical scenario there .
It does n't really matter for this scenario that we 're laying out here .
This would be representing M1 - A1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing .
You have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge .
Makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side .
Potentially chemical weapons , too .
As we turn the other direction , what you 'll see are these Iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there .
They have burns in front of them , artillery behind them firing back .
And then they there goes the smoke screen .
The idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the oncoming forces firing at you from being able to see .
It does n't work , though .
It works both ways .
It obscures you but also obscures them .
Here 's an f .
He comes in and wants to identify his target and he 's got a big --
Ca n't see through the smoke .
We 've got some techniques we 're going to show you .
Somewhere near we can put down special --

In the Groove , or in a Rut ?
- Life in Middle Age
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Middle age is the most awkward time .
It 's the age when you ca n't get to sleep till dawn .
The age of sighs but not passion .
The age of sorrow but not anger .
In middle age , you kiss girls on the forehead , not the lips .
It 's the age when you drink strong coffee and take stomach pills .
The age when the phrase " you ca n't escape convention " says it all .
Middle age is afternoon tea .
-LRB- From " Middle Age Is Afternoon Tea , " by Tung Chiao -RRB-
" Middle age is the afternoon , but I ca n't say I have much time to drink tea ! "
Sitting in the silence of his research office , Professor Li Liang - che of the psychology department at National Chengchi University appears pensive .
Indeed , passing 40 is like passing noon .
You miss the fresh , pure , carefree feeling of morning , and the arrogance of noon , yet also yearn for the serene splendor of the sunset .
It is only now , in the afternoon , that worries crowd in , and try as you might you can not raise your flagging spirits .
Worries , ennui - is this a case of that fashionable disease of civilization , the " midlife crisis " ?
" If you 're going to have a crisis , it 's most likely to happen during the " midlife transition , " from 40 to 45 , " says Li .
In people of a melancholy and sensitive disposition , or who have faced many setbacks early in life , it may even set in around the age of 35 .
" In the US , 35 is the maximum age for being in a fraternity , " jokes National Taiwan Normal University audiovisual center director Chao Ning , who is known as a " wunderkind " in the broadcasting world .
After that , your moods begin to seesaw between those of " youth " and " middle age . "
You are perfectly sure that you are in as good form as ever , and have not even reached your peak yet , but looking at all those talented youngsters around you , they seem even more outstanding than yourself , and more like tomorrow 's rising stars .
A vexing feeling of being pushed along by the years gradually builds up , until one day you find yourself high and dry on the shoals of life .
Middle age creeps up on you
" The new waves on the Yangtze River push the old waves along " - i.e. each generation outdoes the last - and in an age of rapid change , the sense of crisis this induces in the older generations is amplified .
A Mrs. Wei , who chose to leave her job as a bookkeeper five years ago because of an unexpected pregnancy , thought at the time that with her ability , experience and contacts it would not be hard for her to find a new job once her child started primary school .
But as the day of her return to the world of work draws ever nearer , she feels a growing sense of panic .
" Most of my old colleagues have left , and the few I 'm still in touch with talk about nothing but things like Excel spreadsheets that I know nothing about ! "
Mrs. Wei has hinted a few times to her husband that she should just stay at home and concentrate on looking after the children .
But thinking of her husband 's grim expression whenever he gives her the housekeeping money , she does n't dare to say it plainly .
In today 's society , youth is beauty .
But in trying to show he was not out of touch with youth , Mr. Chou , the 45 - year - old boss of a computer components company , had an experience which left him not knowing whether to laugh or cry .
He arranged with his young employees to go for a barbecue in a river valley , hoping to get to know them better .
But when they arrived there , the workers formed their own groups , laughing and clowning around , and left him to get on with barbecuing the meat .
When it was done - and he was drenched in sweat - the young people , attracted by the aroma , gathered round .
But after giving him a few words of praise , they wolfed down the food and scattered again immediately , as if he did n't even exist .
" They probably thought their old fogey of a boss had just come to wait on them ! "
From then on Mr. Chou , having recognized his own place in the order of things , made no more attempts to ingratiate himself with his young employees - and in fact felt much the more relaxed for it .
More crises in middle age ?
" By middle age , you have more experience of life , and you are sure to have various realizations and regrets , " says Li Liang - che .
Even if you have no economic worries and as yet no health problems , nonetheless the flowing river of life has carried away your youth , ideals , pure love and even your loved ones , and left you with many wounds you are loth to touch and regrets you are loth to remember .
The sense that the realization of past mistakes has come too late to put them right , and of your remaining days being numbered , makes you feel despondent .
But despondency need not amount to a " crisis . "
According to overseas research , although people have more worries in middle age , only around 15 % have emotional difficulties serious enough to require psychological counseling or medication .
Sociology professor Wang Ya - ke of National Taipei University , who has always been an ardent supporter of feminism and recently became the first scholar to promote " male studies " in Taiwan , offers the following analysis :
The real reason why the " midlife crisis " has become such a hot topic in the US lies with the 75 million " baby boomers " born in the postwar period from 1946 to 1964 .
One can say that this huge generation is the one with the highest level of achievement , and the most diverse set of values , in human history .
Since they gradually began to enter middle age in the late 1980s , they have produced many reminiscences and introspective works about their own mental and spiritual journey , which have elicited a strong response .
The US 's present middle - aged generation have metamorphosed from youthful anti-war protesters and hippies into yuppie managers of multinational corporations , and from idealists into materialists .
The tensions and trauma of that transformation cause their " midlife crisis " to be especially complex .
By contrast , although Taiwan had its own baby boom from 1951 to 1966 , its middle - aged generation have not had the same life experiences , so while they too have their midlife crises , they are much less complex .
Alice Lu , director of the International Family Life Education Center , suggests that " change " would be a better term than " crisis " for the mood swings and difficulties of middle age .
Midlife change , in fact , is a natural process in the journey of life , and as people grow older and have to shoulder ever heavier responsibilities , all kinds of pressures large and small appear together at this time of life .
For example , says Lu , middle - aged people are the meat in a generational sandwich .
Their aging parents increasingly need care , while at the same time their teenage children are at their most rebellious .
Other elements in their lives , such as their job or marriage , have been in existence for ten to 20 years ; the sparkle is gone , yet they have invested too much to just walk away from them .
And again , turning to look at themselves , gray hairs are sprouting from their temples and crows ' feet appearing at the corners of their eyes , their jowls are sagging , and the thick , solid chest muscles of their youth have somehow migrated down to their bellies .
When they take their sons out for some exercise , they do n't even have the strength to do a single pull - up !
Midlife brings many uncertainties , and if it comes in a time of dramatic social change when many role models are being completely rewritten , middle - aged people may be left even more at a loss .
Life is long , the future bleak
Li Liang - che notes that firstly , life expectancy has rapidly increased .
In Taiwan , average life expectancy has risen steadily from 55 years in 1951 to 75 today .
As the journey of life lengthens , middle - aged people become more and more confused about their status in life .
A Mr. Chang , who lives in Hualien , is now 58 , nearing the upper end of middle age .
He recalls that when he saw his parents at age 60 he thought they were " ever so old , " and they seemed quite content to dandle their grandchildren , oblivious to the affairs of the world .
But now that he is approaching the same age himself , he feels he is not yet qualified to call himself old , and still less to speak lightly of retiring .
" We 're living longer , but life is more tiring ! "
He asks , only half in jest : How come nowadays middle age seems to drag on forever ?
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences .
In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .
At the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time .
With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even - as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people - in different countries , many middle - aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .
Hospital worker Lin Mei - lun -LRB- not her real name -RRB- , lives in Kaohsiung with her two children .
Her ex-husband works in Tainan , and for many years during their marriage he only came home at weekends .
Early last year a late - night phone call shattered the peaceful life she had worked so hard to build .
At the other end was a woman who venomously demanded that Lin Mei - lun give up her husband , or she would bring along her three - and - a - half - year - old illegitimate son and make a scene at the hospital !
The unbearable anguish of being
" Actually , it 's not as if I did n't have my suspicions all those years .
But I never thought things would turn out so awful !
How could I have been such a fool ? "
For the next six months , Lin Mei - lun could hardly sleep or eat .
By day she dragged herself to work like a zombie , but in the middle of the night she would wake with a start , her heart pounding so hard she could n't breathe .
The affair finally ended in divorce , but the upside is that since then her ex has actually behaved better , for he has begun to commute back to Kaohsiung from Tainan every day , and is much more patient with his son and daughter than before .
At present they are planning to remarry , but Lin worries that once her husband is again bound by the chains of marriage , he might return to his old ways .
" Life in middle age is like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle in a gale .
The more you look at the parts you 've already assembled , the more disjointed and ugly they seem ; but it 's the parts you ca n't finish that you long for more and more , even though you know there 's precious little hope you 'll ever get them done . "
Ms. Lin , who turned 40 this year , says with an air of resignation that if a gust of wind blows the whole puzzle away , the sense of dismay and panic at being tricked by fate can drive you to distraction .
Lin Mei - lun 's mother often comes to stay , and this has done much to lighten the burden of running her household .
But many people who arrive in middle age without the support of a family can only try to weather life 's storms alone .
Ms. Chiang , still single at 46 , is an example .
When she worked as a PR manager for foreign companies such as Hewlett - Packard and Texas Instruments , she was always the highly effective superwoman .
But she realized that under the dual pressure of her need for career success and her unfulfilled emotional needs , she was approaching a state of psychological collapse .
Two years ago , she became seriously depressed .
At night she would toss and turn in bed , but the worry that lack of sleep would make her unable to get up in the morning and would affect her work performance made her even less able to sleep .
Years of looking at a computer screen was causing her vision to deteriorate rapidly , and due to working in a sealed high - tech office she was always dogged by colds , so that every day she felt under the weather .
Live for today
" I asked myself , do you really want to carry on like this ?
What matters more , your work or your health ? "
Ms. Chiang had accumulated some savings during her many years at work , but for the first three months after she resigned her job she could not help a sense of panic , feeling anxious that she might be cast out by society , and also fearing the accusing looks of her friends and family .
But gradually she began to learn to relax and let go .
" Zhuangzi says that life is toil and that death is the time for rest , but I do n't believe all that .
It should n't be that way ! "
After three months , Ms. Chiang no longer put herself under pressure , and no longer got worked up about other people 's well - meaning advice .
Once she stopped having to get up early to go to work , her anxiety about insomnia decreased greatly , and when she was able to adjust her living habits according to her own needs , her depression cleared up by itself .
She began decorating her flat , going to the gym , and cooking the food she likes , and even just sitting lost in thought , enjoying the empty spaces in life .
In particular , having freed herself from the barren existence of a " sexless wage slave " she has begun to liberate her emotional side and enjoy the pleasure of being a woman .
On the subject of family affection and affairs of the heart , Ms. Chiang has also come to a realization .
" My mother died young , and my father always regarded us three children as bloodsuckers , and never showed us any love . "
Because of this , Ms. Chiang left home early to live independently .
But in her heart , her desire for love has never ceased .
Perhaps the shadow of her childhood is behind the setbacks in her love life , so that even today she is still single .
At present , Ms. Chiang has a boyfriend ten years her junior .
" We do n't constrain each other or force each other into anything .
We 're only together when we really want to be . "
The year before last when her father was dangerously ill , he constantly rang his children , begging for their love , which aroused both her sympathy and her disgust .
Having seen through the inconstancy of family affection and romantic attachments , she swore never again to put her emotions at the mercy of others .
She wants to live truly at ease and without being tied down .
Keeping loneliness at bay
For Ms. Chiang , the single life has its freedoms and its loneliness .
But do those who are surrounded by a family have more peace of mind and happiness ?
" No , not necessarily , " answers 51 - year - old Hsiang Chi - tai , a manager at a newspaper , shaking her head .
For the last two years Hsiang Chi - tai has been plagued with capsulitis in her shoulder , and one morning when she could n't manage to fasten her bra before setting off for work , she woke up her son , a university student , to help her .
But her son said banteringly : " You old women really are a pain ! "
Once , Ms. Hsiang asked her two sons which of them was going to look after her when she was old .
But her sons tossed the question back and forth and finally nominated their rather bossy seven - year - old girl cousin !
" I knew they were only joking , but I could n't help feeling sad , and it made me even more aware that in everything you can only rely on yourself .
Anything else is phony ! " says Hsiang .
Having a husband and children , her mother and a lot of friends and relations , and with plenty to do , Ms. Hsiang is never alone , yet she can not help feeling lonely .
Sometimes at night she ca n't sleep and gets up to mop the floor .
For a time she even started playing Tetris .
" Lying in bed , playing with complete concentration , not thinking about anything else , I got up to scores of tens of thousands of points ! " she says , finding this ridiculous even herself .
" Whenever I notice I 'm getting down , I start looking for things to do , " she says .
Middle age is a minefield , and you must n't fall into the trap of letting yourself get downhearted !
The best laid plans
Apart from those to do with health , marriage and work , many other unexpected changes may occur in middle age .
When he was 38 , Chao Ning , who is now a director of the Buddhist satellite TV station LTV and the producer of many Buddhist TV programs , was invited to Houston , Texas to give a lecture .
On the plane he happened to meet Buddhist Master Hsingyun of Foguangshan Temple .
After 14 hours of the master earnestly speaking to him about the principles of Buddhist life , " Even a stone would have been moved ! "
After Chao 's lecture in Houston was over , he immediately took a plane to Los Angeles and went to Hsi Lai Temple , which was just being built .
There he sought out Master Hsingyun and declared his conversion to Buddhism , and since then he has never touched a drop of alcohol .
" Before that , I always had a rhyming couplet pasted up by my doorway which read : ' I know there is wine in this world , / But not that it can make you drunk , ' which was my way of bragging about my drinking prowess . "
What power caused him to make such a great change ?
Chao Ning himself ca n't explain .
" In the US , 38 and 49 are special ages .
I had come to realize many things , and when fate brought the right opportunity , I was ready for a change of heart , " says Chao .
He converted to Buddhism at 38 , got married at " 491?2 , " and before many years had become the " super-old dad " of three children .
The changes in Chao Ning 's life in middle age can not be described as small .
" Looking back , it seems that none of the road I took in life is what I expected . "
Chao reveals that 40 years ago when he was taking his college entrance exams , he put down all kinds of choices of university but deliberately did not include NTNU , because he thought he was not interested in being a teacher .
But although he did not study at NTNU , he went to teach there , and has been there for over 20 years .
" Every year I make a big palaver about wanting to plan my life and how I 'm going to give up teaching and concentrate on broadcasting . "
Chao continues with the same forthright , sincere smile :
" But who 'd have thought that in the blink of an eye my colleagues would be telling me : ' Old Chao , you need n't bother planning , you 're soon going to retire ! ' "
Although he never got around to planning his life , Chao , who has always liked to " follow his feelings , " feels that every step he has taken has been steady and enriching .
Now that he is about to leave middle age for the age of wisdom , this causes him to walk on eagerly , with a spring in his step .
His only real worry is for his three children , now aged seven , five and two years old .
Not daring to get old
" Sometimes when I look at their lovely faces while they sleep , I feel I hav n't done right by them , because I 'm so much older than they are . "
The phrase most often on Chao Ning 's lips nowadays is , " Because my kids are small , I ca n't get old just yet . "
Chao plays basketball three times a week , and is early to bed and early to rise .
Having become a father in middle age , he is doing his best to stay young for his children .
Midlife changes may , as for Chao Ning , be one 's own choices and bring satisfaction .
But there are so many changes which are not chosen and are impossible to prevent , and of these unemployment is one of the most fearsome .
The economic malaise which has spread through Taiwan in just the last two years is rapidly overtaking tens of thousands of middle - aged workers .
" A few days ago I heard about the death of a friend of mine .
After he was forced to retire from Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corporation , he set up a stand selling grilled food at Chichin bathing beach in Kaohsiung .
But before long he died of a coronary . "
Simon Chang , former managing director of the Chunghwa Telecom employees ' union , says that on hearing the news , many of the deceased man 's good friends could not help thinking : " If we 'd known he 'd die so young , we should n't have stopped him that time when he wanted to go after the boss of TMMC with a Molotov cocktail ! "
Chang , who worked at CHT for over 10 years , says that next year the company plans to cut its workforce by a full 3,000 people , which means that within the next year 3,000 people will be " forced to retire . "
But the average age of CHT 's workers is only 46
!
Who will tell me ? !
Forty - six - what an awkward age .
The majority of these workers are carrying the tremendous burden of being the breadwinner for three generations .
" The sense of uncertainty about employment has begun to affect every facet of life . "
Simon Chang says that this is a cause of marital tension , and these workers have thousands of questions sticking in their throats , such as : Will they have to interrupt their children 's education ?
Should they accept a transfer , and move the whole family somewhere else ?
What kind of second skill should they learn to keep themselves employable ?
How long a buffer period can the company give them ?
But nobody is willing to give them a clear answer .
Chang suggests that rather than the government spending vast amounts on unemployment benefits , it would be better for it to set up a life guidance and psychological counseling system for workers at all state - owned and private enterprises , as quickly as possible .
" What we want is n't money , but clear guidance to the future ! "
" For a middle - aged person , losing one 's job is just as traumatic as a car accident , falling ill , the death of a spouse or a child running away from home .
It 's an event beyond their control which suddenly turns their life upside - down . "
Chiu Chia - li , director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center , describes this kind of occurrence as a " non-normative event . "
Such events are much more traumatic than " normative events " such as job stress , a parent being paralyzed , children growing up and leaving home , or being passed over for promotion , all of which are more predictable .
Looking around us , there are many middle - aged people who , although one can not say they are unemployed , do n't have a regular career .
In his youth , Lin Hung - kui of Chungli in Taoyuan County started up in business from nothing , selling shaved iced snacks .
He did well , and used his money to buy three or four shops and apartments .
In the end he gave up his shop because the work became physically too demanding , but after several failed attempts in other lines of business , today he can only live on his savings and the rent from his apartments .
He has enough to get by , but spending the whole day doing nothing he finds it difficult to face the inquiring glances of neighbors .
Two years ago , encouraged by his wife , who works for an estate agency , Lin went on a pre-work training course at the agency .
Being stuck in among a group of young kids in their twenties , and being subjected to " shock style " training - including listening to pep talks , singing military songs and shouting slogans at the tops of their voices - made Lin feel very uncomfortable .
Finally , after sticking it out for a month , he quit the job on receiving his first pay packet .
" There are many things which young people can do without any inhibitions , but in middle age you build yourself all kinds of high walls which are very hard to escape from . "
Lin counts himself lucky , for he does n't need to break his back just to earn a pittance .
But his mood is always uncertain .
In the last two years he has begun studying the Book of Changes and fengshui , in the hope that he can take his life to a higher level .
A second spring
" In the US , indecision and depression often drive middle - aged people , especially women , to return to college , to clarify their future path through further study . "
Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center director Chiu Chia - li quotes her own experience .
At one time she worked simultaneously as a clothing designer , a part - time community worker and a counselor .
Coming from a poor background , she always worked hard to hold down these three jobs .
But the more she saw of life , the more dissatisfied she felt with her own situation , and hoped she could make a new breakthrough .
Although she had been cautious all her life , at the age of 42 she quit her jobs , and with a sense of release tinged with trepidation , went to study overseas .
After leaving Taiwan , Chiu found a school in New York where most of the students were about her age .
Like her , many had come there because they had arrived at a point where they did not know what to do with their lives .
They had not come to earn a degree , but simply , through the process of study , to " sort out their lives bit by bit . "
After five years in New York , Chiu felt she had developed a great deal , and had enough strength to help people who needed help .
So she returned to Taiwan to become a full - time counselor .
" When I felt that I had reached a crisis , I did n't run away from it , but made the crisis into a challenge and faced it with courage . "
Looking back on this phase of her life , Chiu can not suppress a smile .
" I would n't call it success , and it does n't mean I do n't have any struggles left in my life .
But I know I 've had at least one experience of winning a battle with myself , so I can walk my future path more firmly . "
Everyone 's story of middle age is different ; the joys and sorrows of middle age mean different things to different people .

Title : Something Even More Absurd Than the " Breakneck 90 M/H On a Snowy Night " ?? My Personal Experience .
Originating site : BBS Unknown Space -LRB- Tue Jan 16 22:51:46 2007 -RRB- .
I have deep feelings and a lot of sympathy with the author after reading the article Breakneck 90 m/h on a Snowy Night .
It also reminds me of something that I experienced several years ago , also related to an airport and meeting people .
A couple of years ago , my neighbor approached me to borrow my car , saying he was meeting his parents at the airport .
He also said both his wife and children wanted to go .
As his car was too small and mine was big , it could make his parents more comfortable .
He added that he would only use it for one morning and would return it to me before noon .
Although there was only a nodding acquaintance between the neighbor and me , we lived in the same apartment building after all and were both Chinese .
So I discussed with my wife back home and lent him the car as we thought we would not be using the car until the same afternoon .
And then something happened ...
At 1:00pm , the neighbor called me , saying he took his parents to a buffet and would probably not to be back until around 3:00pm .
I of course agreed and asked them not to rush .
This wait lasted till 5:30pm , when the neighbor told me in a half - crying tone that there was an accident , and everyone else was intact , except his father , who was in hospital for fractures .
I comforted him first and asked my friend to rush me to the hospital .
My neighbor showed me the police report at the hospital , which indicated it was all my neighbor 's fault .
He clashed into a truck going straight when he made a left turn .
My car was completely damaged and had been towed away .
I forced myself to refrain from the grief of loosing my beloved car -LRB- mine was liability - only coverage -RRB- and asked the friend to send their family home .
And then the nightmare began .
The next day , my neighbor called me , saying his father needed to undergo an operation in hospital and asked where the money would come from
I told him part would be covered by my car insurance .
After a while , he called again , saying the operation charge was high and it was difficult for them to afford
I tried my best to comfort him then and told him to think of a way slowly
Just then , a nearly crazy voice of a woman came from the other end of the line , saying her family had just saved several dozen thousand bucks for the down payment of a house ; where would they live afterwards if they spent this .
She also said my car was a Japanese one , which had poor safety performance and it was my car to blame for the car accident .
She added that I should pay the money because the car was mine .
I hung up the phone angrily as the dialog could not go on .
My wife -LSB- pw% -RSB- had been persuading me aside , saying some women would easily lose mind once in fury .
She asked me to take no heed of them and let them calm down first .
So I did n't take their words seriously but still felt angry .
Out of my expectation , a phone call on the third day completely changed my original idea .
The telephone rang just as I was about to go to work in the morning .
I thought it was a sales call and was prepared to end it perfunctorily .
Unexpectedly , coming from the other end of the line was a deep and resolute voice of a middle - aged man .
He said in an incontestable tone that my neighbor had a car accident as a result of borrowing my car , which traumatized them both physically and mentally and harmed their economic interests , and as the car owner , they would not sue me if I compensated them for the hospital charge and the costs of missing work hours -LRB- three times -RRB- , otherwise they would see me in court .
He added that he was certain about the case as a lawyer in business for ten years and the compensation he requested could double in court .
As a great Chinese guy , how could I be scared by a few remarks of the lawyer ?
I also took up the weapon of law for justice .
Of course , I also retained a lawyer .
Out of my expectation , my lawyer solved the problem by merely making two phone calls .
One was to the police station , asking for any additional findings in the investigation report of the accident .
There was additional findings unexpectedly , which were against them .
Someone at the junk yard found a bottle of unfinished wine without the lid inside the car and reported it to the police station .
The police found they put the bottle of unfinished wine in the car without the lid after lunch .
The second call was to their lawyer .
So their lawyer dropped the lawsuit .
Of course , they would not stop it there and came to discuss with me several times , sometimes honey - tongued and sometimes threatening .
The most classic one was : Do n't ever dream of living a life back to China , as we have people across the country .
Disgusting !
Here comes the old topic again , are you going to lend your car if your neighbor or friend asks .
I think many people will say they wo n't .
I would suggest not to lend online .
However , the Internet is after all virtual .
Words sometimes have no emotions .
When your seemingly nice neighbor , seemingly close friend , or a girl whose eyes can speak asks for it in the real world , how many people will answer with a " no ? "
Anyhow , I was not able to do that .
I lent my car to some people in need after that , and I believe there are not many people like my former neighbor couple .
In conclusion , here is a summery of the loss of the two sides : .
Our side : A 02 Camary of 50,000 miles , retaining fee 200 . Annual leave two days .
Their side : One leg of the father -LRB- repaired -RRB- , hospital charge : unknown , costs for missing work hours : unknown , retaining fee : unknown .
And most importantly : the dignity and honor of the entire family -LRB- except children -RRB- .

Yugoslavia is a step closer to ending its years of isolation and socialist power .
Yugoslavia 's parliament today appointed a new government backing reformist President Vojislav Kostunica .
It 's the country 's first communist - free government in more than half a century .
The new cabinet won approval in both chambers of parliament and from deputies of Yugoslavia 's two republics -- Serbia and Montenegro .

Britain 's Millennium Dome will close down this coming Monday after a year of mishaps .
Officials at London 's Millennium Dome say the structure will close down after a final New Year 's Eve party .
They say it will be likely sold to a developer and be turned into a technology park .
Problems riddled the Dome even before its grand opening last New Year 's Eve .
Construction delays and cost - overruns hurt the project , which was originally expected to cost at least 1 billion 300 million dollars .
Dome officials had to seek an additional 265 million dollars to complete the structure .

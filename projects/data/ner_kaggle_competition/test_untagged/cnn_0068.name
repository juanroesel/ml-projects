Secret new evidence has prompted another delay in the trial of two Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 .
Tom Mintier has details .
Already in its sixth month , the Lockerbie trial of two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland 12 years ago is moving at a snail 's pace .
The latest series of delays come as new information has been revealed to the defense by the prosecution .
Such a move in the middle of a trial is considered highly unusual unless the information is so sensitive it could harm the case if not revealed during the trial .
The information includes details of six new potential witnesses and other information from six countries on three different continents .
It is not yet clear whether the new information will help or hurt the case against the two Libyans accused of blowing up the airplane .
Prosecutors have handed over a file described in court as being an inch thick .
Defense lawyers say the new information , if true , will have the greatest conceivable effect on the trial .
Two weeks ago , prosecutors revealed the existence of the new information and just this Monday , handed it over to defense lawyers .
Teams of investigators have now fanned out to conduct interviews related to this new information for the defense team .
That information could cause the trial to be delayed even further .
The defense team has already told the court that more time may be required to react to the new information .
So far , the three Scottish judges sitting to hear this case have not been told any of the details of the new information .
That may change next week if and when another delay in the trial is requested by the defense .
Just how important is the new information ?
That is difficult to say , because so far , only investigators and lawyers for the defense and prosection know what it is .
In court on Tuesday , one of the lawyers for the defense defended all the secrecy saying , `` lives are in danger . ''
At one time , there were predictions that this trial would be completed before November and the U.S. elections for President .
Now it is looking more likely to spill into the new year , but no one is exactly willing to say which new year .

Lawyers in Texas are trying to keep their client from becoming the 300th person executed in the state since 1982 , when Texas resumed capital punishment .
They 're asking the Supreme Court to block tonight 's scheduled execution of Delma Banks .
Banks was convicted of shooting and killing a 16 - year - old at a park in 1980 .
His lawyers say his trial attorney did a bad job and the prosecutors improperly kept African - Americans off his jury .
He 'd be the 11th killer put to death in Texas this year .

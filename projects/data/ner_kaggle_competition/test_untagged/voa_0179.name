US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has extended an emergency order to keep electricity flowing to California .
The measure will require western suppliers to sell power to the state for at least another week .
As we hear from Michael Sullivan , the official also proposed an energy price cap for the West , but the suggestion had a mixed response from western governors .
The extension of the federal order will require power suppliers in the West to keep sending their surplus electricity to California .
Electrical resources in the West Coast state are stretched to their limit with a looming threat of rolling blackouts .
California 's utility companies are not able to generate all the power their customers need , so they have turned to outside suppliers and in the face of rising prices the state 's two largest utility firms have sunk more than eight billion dollars in debt .
Suppliers outside California had threatened to cut off the power , afraid that the cash - strapped utilities were not able to pay for it .
The emergency order last week and the extension announced in Denver at a meeting of western governors will keep electricity flowing to California through the middle of next week .
The crisis began three years ago when California imposed a price freeze on its private utility firms to protect consumers while the state deregulates its energy sector , but the lifting of market controls led to wild price fluctuations on the wholesale market .
This was made worse by several factors .
No new generating stations have been built in the state in recent years and some existing generators are offline for repairs .
At the same time California has been growing .
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says it is a case of demand outpacing supplies .
I know in California alone in the last year electricity demand has increased 13 % .
California 's wholesale electricity prices , which had been capped at 250 dollars per megawatt hour in a regulated market , have peaked under deregulation at 1400 dollars per megawatt hour .
With the current price freeze , utilities have been prevented from passing along the increase to consumers .
Wednesday , Energy Secretary Bill Richardson suggested a new price cap for electricity throughout the western states .
Oregon 's Governor supports the idea .
Some other western leaders are not convinced that a price cap will solve the problem .
Energy suppliers oppose a cap , saying instead they need incentives to build more generating stations .
Last week federal regulators imposed a so - called soft cap on California , which requires power firms to justify prices above 150 dollars per megawatt hour .
The measure does not however prevent them from charging above that level .
One large utility company , Southern California Edison says it may have to file for bankruptcy unless government officials can offer some relief .
The privately owned company is now three and a half billion dollars in debt .
Consumer activists are skeptical .
They know the utility recently declared a dividend for its stockholders , but Edison 's Tom Higgins says the firm can not continue to pay high prices for electricity while keeping prices low for its customers .
Our books are an open matter .
It 's not hard for anybody to see .
They can talk to the banks themselves and see that you know , clearly we do n't have the ability to do this .
We do n't print money in the basement .
California 's Governor this week warned that intermittent cutoffs of power around the state may begin as early as next week if nothing more is done to alleviate the crisis .

Duane Walker , `` CNN Headline Sports . ''
Week ten of the NFL season , and for the first time in a Washington Redskins uniform , Jeff George will get the starting nod at quarterback against the Arizona Cardinals .
Brad Johnson is out because of a sprained knee ligament .
I would think where we 're at that Brad will be out of the game .
My guess is -- I mean , I 'd like him to be at least be able to dress , but I 'm not sure he 'll even be able to do that .
If we where he s and be an emergency third , that would probably be the best we could hope for .

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he is freezing tens of millions of dollars in tax payments to the Palestinian Authority as outside efforts to stop the Israeli - Palestinian violence continue .
Prime Minister Barak said late Thursday , he is withholding the money until the Palestinians abide by previous agreements with the Israelis .
Mr. Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held separate talks Thursday with both US envoy Dennis Ross and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov .
Both urged the Middle East leaders to resume peace talks and to stop the violence that has killed more than 200 Palestinians since late September .

Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , April 5th , by reporter Guocheng Jiang
" Five years ago , when China 's digital telephone program - controlled switch market was monopolized by various brands of foreign products , we worried about whether China could successfully develop digital program - controlled switches .
Today , domestically produced high - performance telephone program - controlled telephone switches already account for 36 % of the domestic market share . "
" When China 's National Meteorological Bureau bought mainframe computers from Cray Inc. of the U.S. , it just sold us two processors .
Today , the maximum computing speed of the ' Dawn 1000 ' computer we developed ourselves has already reached 2.5 billion operations per second , exceeding the speed of the computer sold to us by Cray Inc. "
This is part of the speech delivered at the working meeting of the " 863 Program " today by Jian Song , State council member and concurrently director of the National Science Commission .
The " 863 Program " is China 's high - tech research program , initiated in 1986 .
Western developed countries have always restricted the export of important high - tech products , such as high - performance large - scale digital telephone program - controlled switches and supercomputers , to China .
Jian Song said that " Today , China is capable of producing more than 10,000 sets of digital telephone program - controlled switches , and the chief designer of this kind of switch is only 28 years old , graduating from Wuhan University . "
Most of the research staff who successfully developed the ' Dawning 1000 ' computer last year are young people about 30 years old .
Today , Jian Song said to hundreds of high - tech experts representatives and science and technology officials attending the meeting : " The series of achievements we have made in the development and industrialization of high - tech help us to further overcome timid thoughts that high - tech is unattainable .
They have greatly enhanced our whole nation 's courage and confidence in realizing socialist modernization . "
The " 863 Program " , with a total investment of 10 billion yuan RMB and a duration of 15 years , since its implementation in 1986 , has gained breakthroughs in a large number of significant key fields of technology .
It has greatly narrowed the gap between China 's high - tech and the internationally advanced levels , and has promoted the modernization of civilian industry and the national defense industry .
In the civilian fields of biotechnology , information technology , automation technology , energy technology and new materials technology alone , more than 1200 research achievements have been made , of which 560 have reached internationally advanced levels .
This aside , China has scheduled more than 400 research projects in the fields of aerospace technology and laser technology , involving space science and application , jumbo carrier rockets , space stations , space shuttle transportation systems , and has made phased achievements in certain key technology fields .
Jian Song also cited the significant achievements that the internationally advanced level gained in fields such as agricultural biotechnology , biomedicine , genetic engineering , lasers , robotics , etc .
For example , a Chinese developed genetically engineered Hepatitis B vaccine and an " a " interferon for blocking the progress of Hepatitis B have entered the market , which is good news for the 120 million Hepatitis B virus carriers in China .
Later stages of Hepatitis B often develop into liver cancer .
China has determined its focus of high - tech research for the coming five years , and set about drawing up the next century 's high - tech research plans .
Finally , Jian Song said , " Whether our own high - tech and its industry can be successful is related to the success or failure of China 's undertaking of modernization , and is related to the rise and fall of the Chinese people .
To vigorously develop high - tech and establish a powerful national high - tech industry in our country as soon as possible is an urgent task currently facing China 's scientific and technological circles and economic circles . "

Good evening , everyone .
We begin tonight with a couple of urgent questions for the government .
There 's a man on trial in New York for bombing the American embassy in Kenya two years ago .
The FBI says when they questioned him , he told them of another plot to bomb an American ship in Yemen , where the `` USS Cole '' was ultimately attacked .
Question one , did the FBI make it clear what the man had told them ?
Question two , did the Pentagon and the CIA get the message and do nothing about it ?
Here 's your national correspondent , John M Wethy .
In the days after the bombing of the American embassy in Nairobi , Mohammed Al - owhali was arrested by Kenyan authorities and interrogated by the FBI .
He told the FBI he participated in the attack under direction of terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden .
ABC News has learned he also provided details of a plan to attack an American warship in Yemen .
Al - owhali said it would be a rocket attack , conducted by a Bin Laden terrorist cell , and it would come in the next few months .
The next morning , August 1998 , the FBI sent out a classified message , under Director Louis Freeh 's name , warning of a plot to attack a U.S. Navy ship in Yemen .
The FBI message went to three Pentagon agencies , and as a result , the visit of one American warship to Yemen was canceled .
The warning came as General Anthony Zinni was finalizing an agreement for refueling ships in the Yemeni port of Aden .
It apparently left no lasting impression .
Zinni testifying after the attack on the `` USS Cole '' -- Aden never had a specific terrorist threat .
All the other ports that have been mentioned here that we should have considered as options have had specific threats .
So what happened to the FBI warning ?
CIA officials say they never received it .
FBI officials say they did copy the CIA .
Pentagon officials say they got the warning , but had no idea it the source was such a well - connected insider within Bin Laden 's organization .
This raises a fundamental question -- if the message had been more clearly communicated and understood , would American lives have been saved ?
John M Wethy , ABC News , the Pentagon , still looking for answers .

United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Emily Robinson came perilously close to swelling the casualty tolls Sunday when a convoy carrying her through the West Bank was fired upon , but Ross Dunn reports , she escaped unharmed if unhappy .
Mrs. Robinson , the head of the UN Human Rights Commission , got a first hand look at the violence sweeping through the Palestinian territories when she visited the West Bank town of Hebron .
They bulleted a car and a three - vehicle convoy transporting Mrs. Robinson and her staff as she toured one of the major flash points in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
No one was hurt in the shooting but eyewitnesses reported that the UN Human Rights Chief was visibly upset following the incident .
Mrs. Robinson is on a fact - finding mission following complaints by Palestinians that Israeli soldiers have used excessive force in a bid to quell more than six weeks of rioting in the territories .
The shooting of her convoy followed an exchange of gunfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen .
Both Israel and the Palestinians blamed each other for the attack .
The Israeli Army said that the Palestinian gunmen had fired at Mrs. Robinson 's car .
Palestinian police said that militant Jewish settlers in Hebron had fired at the convoy in an Israeli controlled part of the town .
Although the town is under the civil control of the Palestinian Authority , Israeli troops are stationed in the center of Hebron to protect about 400 Jewish settlers .
The settlers worship at a shrine in the heart of the town , holy to both Muslims and Jews , and say they will never leave Hebron despite almost daily attacks in the past six weeks against their homes .

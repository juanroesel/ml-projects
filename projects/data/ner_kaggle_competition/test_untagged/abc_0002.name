Finally this evening -- the auctioneers .
Here in New York today , the gigantic international auction house Sotheby 's pleaded guilty to price - fixing with Christie 's -- its only real competition in an industry that does $ 4 billion in business every year .
This is a case of the rich and the powerful stifling competition .
Here is ABC 's Aaron Brown .
Sold for $ 200,000 .
Diana Brooks was at home on center stage in the toney world of high - priced art .
As President of Sotheby 's , she often conducted the biggest , the highest profile auctions , like the Kennedy family treasures , herself .
Sold for $ 95,000 .
Today , she took center stage in a far grittier place , pleading guilty to bilking hundreds of wealthy art patrons out of tens of millions of dollars .
Those charged engaged in classic cartel behavior -- price fixing , pure and simple .
The cartel consisted of Sotheby 's and Christie 's .
Arch rivals for nearly three centuries , the two auction houses agreed to fix prices on what they charged the buyers and sellers of high - priced art .
Even arch rivals , it seems , have a common bond .
Sotheby 's and Christie 's are all about money .
They are dealing with art , history and beautiful things , but at the end of the day , people go to Sotheby 's and Christie 's because they believe they can get best price for them .
They have already agreed to pay more than $ 500 million to settle the civil suits spawned by their crimes .
Ms. Brooks , who could go to prison and will certainly be heavily fined has agreed to turn state 's evidence , turning against her boss .
She becomes Sammy `` the bull '' Gravano with better taste , and the art world , well , while being more careful , perhaps , it continues to do business with the same two companies who for years swindled them .
I think the impact has been negligible .
Much to a lot of people 's surprise , business seems to be booming .
Consignments still seem to be as high as they were before the scandal broke .
Which may be the clearest proof yet that the rich are different from the rest of us .
$ 1.3 million .

Violence is flaring again today in the Middle East .
At a checkpoint near Ramallah , Israeli troops opened fire with machine guns when someone apparently shot at them from a nearby building .
A police station in Ramallah was one of the targets of Israeli helicopter strikes yesterday after a mob beat two Israeli soldiers to death .
The soldiers had been taken to the station after apparently inadvertently taking a wrong turn .
In Jerusalem , Israeli security forces scuffled with Palestinians near the Al - aksa Mosque .
Only worshipers older than 45 are being allowed into the mosque today .
Israeli police are keeping hundreds of young Palestinians away from the shrine .
100 people , most of them Palestinians and Israeli Arabs , have died in violent clashes that began September when Israeli Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon visited the area , which is sacred to both Muslims and Jews .

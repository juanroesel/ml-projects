The title of the theme song for the Championships is very poetic .
It is " Water in Water " .
The words and music of this song were composed by the famous Italian musician Claudio Baglioni .
At the opening ceremony , Baglioni and the 60 year old tenor R. Sceto , sang the theme song together .
Many years ago , Baglioni composed a song named " Little love is as deep as the ocean " and it instantly became a popular hit throughout Italy and made Baglioni widely known as a popular song composer .
But , since 1992 , he has disappeared suddenly from the public eye .
When people were commenting on this , he again emerged mysteriously from obscurity and gave " Water in Water " to everyone which became the theme song of this World Swimming Championships .
Baglioni has had a kind of preference for water since birth .
He said , " Water is a topic which haunts repeatedly in my compositions .
Water is a product of nature .
It has the most natural characteristics of everything .
It is an approach to life and is the headspring of consciousness , emotion and music . "
He also said , " Through swimming and diving sports , we come to understand water and feel its extensiveness and power , from which arises the idea of combining with it as one .
Water makes people no longer separated far away .
In singing " Water in Water " , our hearts beat together . "
The mascot of the World Swimming Championship is a little turtle named " Carota " .
The figure of the turtle was designed by the famous Italian designer W. Lonbado .
Its name came from an innocent and lovely little Italian girl .
Although a small turtle is clumsy on the beach , once in the sea , it becomes agile and free .
On the solid shell of the " little turtle " is embedded a map of the world composed of land and oceans .
It implies that good swimming athletes coming from five continents and four oceans assembled together in Rome to strengthen understanding and enhance friendship through competition .

The United States has lifted some of the economic sanctions it imposed on Yugoslavia two years ago .
As VOA 's Eve Cornet reports from Belgrade , a US special envoy gave the news to President Vojislav Kostunica .
Balkans advisor James O'Brien and President Kostunica met for the first top - level talks between the United States and Yugoslavia , since the break of diplomatic relations on the eve of Nato air strikes in 1999 .
President Kostunica said he was ready for dialogue with the West , but stressed that territorial accords reached with international negotiators in the Balkans should be respected .
Balkans envoy O'Brian stressed that the US would begin lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia and that only technical issues remain an obstacle to reestablishing relations .
However , key sanctions which directly target ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and his allies remain in place .
Meanwhile , parties in Slobodan Milosevic 's socialist coalition are making it clear they plan to hold onto control of the Serbian government , despite calls for new elections .

Most Americans do n't yet have a really good picture of Laura Bush .
To discuss the new first lady , we are rejoined by our panel .
David , why do n't you take a whack at this .
Have you ever met her ?
No , I have n't .
I think it is clear , though , from watching her throughout the past year and a half she is more of the traditional mold of predecessors of Hillary Clinton than like Hillary Clinton .
She is not going to try to break the mold like Mrs. Clinton did by taking an active role in policy making .
A lot of Americans were uncomfortable with that and I think ended up being a mistake .
Joyce , it looks like you want to say something .
I quibble with the idea she is of another generation .
Not every wife necessarily wants to be in politics just because her husband is in politics .
That does n't make her a throwback .
I think , I believe it is probably true , and Hillary also learned in time that it is n't a good idea for the first lady to become too identified with specific policy initiates , at least publicly .
I think she herself pulled back on that .
Well , Deborah , let's us pay proper respect .
She is a teacher and cares about something tremendously important to this country , literacy .
Exactly .
She has worked hard on this issue .
She will tackle the issue the same way Barbara Bush did , encouraging reading .
I 'm sure she will have programs and initiatives .
Hillary Clinton did a lot of things too .
She is out with another book , Entertaining at the White House and Redecorating the White House .
Doing what we think of as more traditional first lady things can be very , very effective .
Deborah , you remember that Mrs. Clinton chafed at the idea of being in the traditional role .
She was not at all happy about it .
In the first campaign she talked about having to bake cookies .
She was n't pleased with that .
That is right .
Joyce makes a good point , too .
After health care reform failed , he changed her steages a bit .
She pulled back .
She began doing more traditional things in public , whereas in private she did still work on the causes she cared about , she advocated and lobbied in a quiet , behind the scenes way .
She did n't make a big deal out of being a co-president anymore .
That is exactly my point , Joe .
Mrs. Clinton wants to deal with policy .
She loves that and is steeped in it .
Clearly Mrs. Bush does n't want to go down that road .
It depends .
Literacy is a big problem in this country .
Nothing that Barbara Bush did or said , with due respect , addressed it in an important way .
It was more of a show .
What needs to be done about literacy is to spend a lot of money , which President - elect Bush proposed .
That was a large spending program , a $ 5 billion literacy program .
Laura Bush could be a big help with that , not like Hillary Clinton with health care , but a symbol with teachers , librarians , people who care about reading and believe every American should be able to read and put clout behind it .
In that way she could be a great asset .
It is a policy that is very hard to disagree with .
She could be the symbol of really doing something .
Let us hope so .
Thank you for talking to us .

A New York Federal Judge says he will allow the alleged confession of a suspect charged in the deadly 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa .
Judge Linnard Sand originally threw out Mohammed Rashid Dawood Alawali 's statement because he said police forced his confession , but he changed his mind after new testimonies showed that the suspect waived his right to speak to an attorney after his arrest .
Mr. Alawali and three others are charged with the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people .

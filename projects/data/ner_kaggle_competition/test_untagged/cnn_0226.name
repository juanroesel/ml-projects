No one seems to be sure what 's happened to Saddam Hussein and his two sons , but one thing is becoming more clear -- Uday and Qusay were just as bad as their father if not worse .
`` Time '' Magazine 's Michael Weisskopf has uncovered some stunning details about the lives of these two .
He joins us now from Washington .
Thanks for taking the time to join us .
Michael , as I read the article , we knew that these were not good guys , putting it mildly , but as you saw and heard the revelations , what were your reactions ?
They 're stomach turning , to put it bluntly .
The extent of the depravity was truly stunning , you 're right and they took different paths , these two guys .
The younger of the two brothers , Qusay was a very professional killer who pulled the trigger with political aim in mind .
We have eyewitnesses to his orders of execution of hundreds of people in 1991 during the Shiite Muslim uprising .
His brother , Uday , was very highly personal , arbitrary , spontaneous in his attacks , extended to young girls , to friends , to employees .
It was just extraordinary .
With Uday , I mean , the stories , you open the article , what you cowrote this article The Sum of Two Evils , The Reign of Terror with Saddam 's sons abducting a 14 - year - old , raping her , crashing wedding parties to rape the brides .
Was that about as bad as it got with these guys ?
I guess it ca n't get much worse .
I thought that the depth may be how he treated his friends , and there are a couple of stories we heard about how he forced friends to drink large quantities of grain alcohol until they vomited .
Also one friend he was afraid was going to leave the country and spill the beans on him , he had him arrested by his Fedayeen Saddam .
He had him held down , tongue pulled out by pliers and sliced off with a scapel .
Awful .
People still fear them and Saddam Hussein himself .
How did you get people to talk ?
Were they forthcoming or pretty reticent about talking about these guys ?
It was a hard report .
It was hard to find people , and then hard to get them to talk .
Over time , we gained trust .
We promised to hold on to people 's anonimity if we could .
After a little while , after we primed the pump , the people wanted to .

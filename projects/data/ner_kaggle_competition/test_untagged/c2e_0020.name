Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist , a great proletarian revolutionary , strategist , and theoretician .
He is China 's greatest patriot and national hero of recent times .
He was a great man of the times who led the Chinese people to completely change their own destiny and national image .
Mao Zedong is the pride of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation .
Mao Zedong transformed China and influenced the world as a great historical figure of the times .
Mao Zedong 's name , Mao Zedong 's spirit , and Mao Zedong 's thought will have increasing influence on China and the world .
Just as General Secretary Hu Jintao said : " In all times and under all circumstances , we must always hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought . "
" The East is red , the sun has risen .
China has brought forth Mao Zedong .
He works for the people 's happiness .
He is the people 's great savior . "
A melody with infinite passion and vigor exuding from the hearts of hundreds of millions of people bounced and echoed in the sky above the earth , touching even more hearts and souls of those with different skin colors , flowing over countries with different cultures .
Just as MCOA says : whoever is the first to pay attention to Chairman Mao , whoever is the first to learn about Chairman Mao , whoever is the first to profoundly understand the essence of Mao Zedong Thought , whoever is the first to use Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong Spirit to guide one 's actions and work will be the first to enjoy the benefits , the first to become strong , the first to be happy , the first to possess wealth , and the first to gain respect of the people .

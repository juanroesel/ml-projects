and all I had to do was get on it and follow it .
I- , I mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck out of me .
I told mom
I said mom it is when you believe in Allah , when you have faith and know when you truly give your heart to Allah , only Allah can make the way clear for you .

And , and , and is she seem like she 's together enough ?
She 's in a , she 's in a two year program .
She 's in the program now .
She 's doing very well .
When I talked to her it 's a , I , I 'm talking to her like I 'm talking to you .
I wrote her a letter and told her
I said I think I said I I feel like I know you even though I never met you .
They seemed surprised that ,
I mean most women you lose your baby that 's it .

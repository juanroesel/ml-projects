Israeli Prime Minister Barak says he will resign tomorrow .
Sometimes things are not as they seem .
This is one of them .
This is a political chess move .
ABC 's Gillian Findlay is in Israel tonight .
It was an emotional speech and one that Israelis had not expected .
`` Tomorrow morning I will inform the President of my decision to resign , '' said Mr. Barak .
`` I will ask again for the trust of the Israeli people . ''
That trust has plummeted in the year and a half since Barak came to power .
Failed peace talks with the Palestinians and the violence that has followed weakened him , strengthened the speculation that former Prime Minister Netanyahu might return to politics and try to unseat him .
Mr. Netanyahu would win easily according to polls .
That may be why Barak has chosen to resign now .
Israel was headed towards an early general election .
By announcing his resignation , Barak has ensured it will be a different election , a special election for Prime Minister only .
Mr. Netanyahu will not be eligible .
That 's because under Israel 's election rules , only a sitting member of parliament can run in a special election .
Mr. Netanyahu gave up his seat when he lost the last election .
Thanks , Gillian Findlay in Israel .

Pepsi hopes to take Quaker Oats to a whole new level .
I 'm Myron Kandel at the cnnfn newsdesk in New York .
Pepsi says it expects to double Quaker 's snack food growth rate .
After a month - long courtship , they agreed to buy Quaker Oats for $ 13.4 billion of their stock , but the assumption of $ 761 million in debt .
That comes to 2 % less a share than Pepsi 's original offer .
The deal gives Pepsi access to Quaker Oats ' Gatorade sport drink as well as Quaker 's profitable snacks business , which makes up about 60 % of its revenue .
Besides Gatorade , they make such products as granola bars , Captain Crunch cereal .
In addition to soft drink , Pepsi also owns Tropicana juices and Frito Lay products .

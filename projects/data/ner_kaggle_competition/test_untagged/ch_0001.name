And guess who called here last night , looking for your address ?
Who ?
Adam Holnick
Adam Holnick ?
Why ?
Well , mommy and I were sea- seated with his mother , I 'm sure this is why . mhm At Lisa 's wedding
uh-huh
and , yeah , we were just talking about you
mhm
and she said that she was sure Adam would love to get in touch with you ,
well guess what ,
he does
oh okay ,
I mean he 's a nice guy and all
uh-huh
Does he know that I live all the way here now ?
well he , well he does now since Alex gave him your address
oh okay
oh that 's funny
oh okay ,
and %hm %um , there are other things I need to tell you .
I was talking to Spencer
uh-huh
and he needs to know a- whether there 'll be more than one set up , or just one set up
just one
now the set up would be you know , everybody being photographed in the same place
yeah ,
I know ,
yeah
just one
one .
okay
and then he needs to kno-
but just tell him I want black velvet
%huh ?
I want black velvet okay backdrop
and that 's that 's it really
okay .
okay .
and then %uh , he needs to know how many different shots you anticipate
yeah
I have to think about that .
okay ,
okay .
we 'll
I told him how many rolls I wanted
uh-huh
%um , did he ,
I told him I wanted ten two and a quarter
okay ,
okay
but I think it might actually have to be more than ten
mhm
Well , I mean obviously , you know , the expenses go up the more he has to shoot
You know what I mean ?
yeah ,
yeah
Like there 's a relationship between the number of rolls he shoots and the cost of the whole -- oh yeah -- thing
no , I know ,
well yeah ,
because he has to take it to a place and then got a contact all of them and right stuff like that
right ,
right .
Well will all of it be black and white ?
%um yes
yes alright
and if it 's not going to cost too much , I 'd like to buy one of the rolls ,
whichever roll is the nicest one uh-huh I 'd like to buy that roll
uh-huh
okay
okay
okay ,
so you 'll have to think about how many different shots there would be like people setups
mhm .
yeah .
okay .
and then do you actually want any photograph taken during the ceremony itself ?
I do n't think so .
what do you think
okay
I think it 's tacky .
yeah .
no I do n't think it either .
okay
mommy never no-
mommy and I did not have any at all
no
I think it 's just going to , it 's going to be hard enough ,
and %uh yeah right , and this g- I , I do n't need that
right
and because in that environment I do n't ,
I think you 're right on that ,
I think it would be awkward .
mhm
%um , and so I think that 's better actually ,
so , if yo- , if you know ,
this way he could just take all the pictures he needs to take actually before the ceremony itself .
mhm .
and what I would like to do which you know I heard about people doing elsewhere , for the color ones during the meal %hm is you know , put some of those disposable cameras on some tables and let , you know
mhm mhm mhm
because then I 'll , I 'll be sure to get pictures from my friends and stuff
mhm , mhm
yeah ,
that 's good
that 's good
everything
What do you think of that ?
yeah
that 's fine .
okay
yeah ,
I think that 's fine .
mhm
okay ,
well I told him I would get back to him .
How many rolls did you tell him ?
I told him ten two and a quarter ,
but okay it 's going to , I think it 's going to have to be more than that .
uh-huh
like twelve to fifteen .
uh-huh
yeah
okay
well anyway , what you do have to think about is the number of sort of people poses
mhm .
yeah .
no I do .
uh-huh
because I mean , you know , he he %ah , he has to allot enou- enough time in order to accomplish all of that .
mhm
you know , it 's not as if ,
and I mean I know what it 's like at Drexel you know , when we have bunches of people getting their pictures taken
mhm
%uh , it takes a while to get them appropriately set up you know
and you have to take several shots of each grouping
and mhm all of that can take a considerable amount of time
yeah
yeah ,
I 'll I 'll %um , I 'll I 'll think about all that .
yeah , okay
and %uh
yeah ,
I 'm also going to have a a list of stuff , of music that I want the D J to play
yeah ,
okay
well you know , any time you f- ,
you could probably let them know that when you come back here
you think so
I would think so
okay
I can call him and ask him , %ah ,
but I , but I think you can probably let them know pretty close to the time itself
okay
but anyway , we 'll find out about that .
%mm
I , %um , i-
you know the invitations have gone out , along with all of the information on travel in Philadelphia ,
I sent a map
mhm mhm
lots of people can see how to get to the Art Alliance you know
oh that 's nice dad
%uh for all the people out of , from out of town
uh-huh
and then I also sent them information on hotels
It turns out that the Barclay okay okay is actually the
right next door
it 's actually the best deal , because they 'll give me the best deal
oh really ,
wait ,
hold on ,
let me get a pen to write this down
uh-huh
okay
I mean the Barclay , which is right across the street , will
Is n't it it 's right next door , right
yeah , right directly across the street
okay
%um , is %um ,
I think it 's ninety nine dollars for a double , and eighty nine dollars for a single ,
is that what it is Alex ?
yeah ,
it 's eighty nine for a single , and ninety nine for a double
okay ,
did you check on triples or no
%ah , no I did n't
but I could do that easily
okay
%uh , I bic-
and at that , that 's a deal ,
that 's not %um yeah , that 's not the regular price the regular price is a hundred and twenty the regular rate ?
okay ,
so we 're taking twenty dollars off ?
yeah they 're taking twenty dollars off .
okay
at the Holiday Inn is actually the same price .
the Holiday Inn man that sounded cr- yucky was %um area was ninety nine dollars for a double , without a continental breakfast , and a hundred and fourteen dollars with the continental breakfast ,
I mean , that 's for two
m-
so , at at the Barclay , do you get breakfast ?
no
no that 's the room
okay
okay
the room cost is that
okay
okay
mhm
but I mean you know as perf- as well as I do that all you , if you want to have a relatively inexpensive meal you walk up to Diner On The Square , two blocks away
yeah .
exactly
and so %um , you know in that area of Penn you can actually eat quite expens- , inexpensively
mhm
%uh , because there are a lot of %um of Asian restaurants that you can walk to within a couple of blocks
mhm
and so you know , it 's a , it 's a it
no ,
I mean there 's Italian restaurants right around there too you know
yeah
I mean there are lots of places where people could eat relatively inexpensively around the Barclay
yeah
%um , and so that actually turned out to be the best deal okay %uh , that could be arranged
and so I you know sent a written statement to all of the people from out of town indicating you know what their options are
okay
and they all have the map as well
okay
okay .
so all of that is working out quite nicely
okay .
%um , as it turns out , the , I think the %um bed and breakfast is cheaper that that
okay
well I can find out about that
I did n't do that yet
yeah ,
did , did you I , should I give you the name of it ?
The Reserve
Reserve
yeah ,
no , I did n't do that one yet
okay
%uh , but I could do that and let you know
yeah ,
could you ask about whether they 'll do triples there uh-huh and rooms with a bathroom ?
uh-huh
okay
Patroli 's mother and grandmothers are going to be you know
uh-huh
Is his father not coming ?
no
okay
so it 's the mother and the two grandmothers , and and his uncle ?
%uh , no , his uncle 's not coming here ,
he 's com- , his uncle 's going to be watching the grandfather
oh , I see
%um , no it 's %ah the person he works for who 's like a really good family friend
oh , you mean the person Charlie works for ?
yeah
oh . what 's his name
name ?
Graham
well that 's what I thought was the uncle 's name
okay
no Peter is the uncle
okay
alright ,
so that 's very nice .
Did you send out the invitations that you got ?
no , not yet
okay
I I 've just been at the
%uh
you want to hear the weirdest thing ?
uh-huh
okay ,
today , I came out of the British Museum ,
and it 's just packed , you know , with tourists yes whatever , and lots of Italians
uh-huh
and I went , out around the corner , and made a 725.48_730.06_B: call home
and as I was standing in the phone booth there was this group of pretty fairly like like , mid teen age year kids walking by
yeah
one of them was just staring at me
and do n't tell me
okay
you cou- , you c-
the young woman the in the house where you stayed in Florence ?
yes
oh my god
Is n't that bizarre ?
and you talked to her ?
I , I , was staring at her ,
then I went out ,
and I could n't remember where I 'd seen her before
uh-huh
and then she was up waiting in front of a bus with all these Italian kids
yeah
yeah
and she just kept staring at me ,
and then as I got close she kind of like yeah walked around like , behind one of her friends or something , like she was nervous or s- something
right , right , right
and I 'm thinking , this is just too weird ,
and I did n't recognize it as her
right
and then I walk past the bus
and I turn around ,
and I just looked at her
uh-huh
and then I just started smiling ,
and she started smiling
and so I kind of knew it was her and everything ,
but uh-huh , uh-huh but %uh , is n't it crazy ?
yeah ,
what was her name ,
Kiara ?
Kiara .
yeah ,
that 's what I thought
yeah
I thought %huh
It is a small world
yeah
%uh , so she was there with some sort of Italian group , %huh ?
well , it was like a school group , or something because it was all kids you know like yeah yeah %huh yeah right fifteen , sixteen years old

Good evening , the United States is bringing most of its investigators home from Yemen .
Things have not gone quite as the U.S. had hoped .
Nearly 200 American agents went to Yemen right after the attack on the `` Cole . ''
A very high profile investigation in a very tense part of the world .
The Yemenis are worried about the threat to their national sovereignty .
We got our closest look at the damage to the `` Cole '' today , but even as we did , and even as the Secretary of State thanked the Yemenis for their early cooporation , investigators in the field think they have hit a brick wall .
ABC 's John Miller reports tonight from the port city of Aden .
The FBI agents moved out in a caravan of trucks and buses , with all their gear in tow .
They are leaving frustrated .
The majority are going home , some will stay on the Tarawa , a Navy ship offshore .
Sources tell ABC News the agents are moving out because of security concerns , but mostly because the Yemeni government is not allowing the FBI to do what it came here to do .
While there has been a great deal of talk about the high level of cooperation between the Yemeni investigators and their American counterparts , in this investigation , there is a growing level of frustration on the part of U.S. officials , because even now , two weeks into the case , no U.S. agent has been given independent access to interview any of the witnesses or suspects .
The FBI was allowed to visit suspected safe houses and collect evidence and fingerprints , but only after Yemeni investigators had been through the houses first .
Yesterday , the American ambassador and a senior FBI official met with President Ally Saleh to complain that Yemeni investigators were not sharing leads or information .
Some U.S. officials believe the Yemeni are concerned about sharing information that could be embarrassing to a country that has been called a haven for terrorists , but U.S. officials say without access to the witnesses here , the future of any American prosecution for the murder of 17 sailors is in doubt .

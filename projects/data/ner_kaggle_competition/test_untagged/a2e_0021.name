Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres began on Monday the highest level visit of an Israeli official to a Gulf country in more than a decade , when he arrived in Qatar for a two - day visit .

The visit is the second for Peres to Qatar , which he visited before in 1996 in his capacity as Prime Minister of Israel , according to the Chairman of the Israeli Commercial Delegation , Roi Rosenblit 's , statement in Doha .
The Israeli official emphasized that the visit has no political tincture and that he has not decided to meet with any Qatari official , -LRB- some sources had indicated that he might meet the Qatari Foreign Minister -RRB- .
He clarified that Peres had accepted an invitation from the BBC to participate in a program called " Doha Debates , " in which several personalities participate .
It is overseen by the First Lady of Qatar , Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al Missned .

Per an invitation from Mozah ?
May God lead you to righteousness , my brother .
What you conveyed just jams the name of Mozah .
I mean , the one who wrote the news deliberately intended it .
He said to his wife : be silent .
And he said to his son : shut up .
Your voices distort my thinking .
Do not utter a word .
I want to write about freedom of expression !

Intended it or not , do you expect that anything happens in Qatar today without the approval of Her Highness Sheikha Mozah ?
Sheikha Mozah seeks to please America by all means , even if all the citizens of the country disagree with her ... and the goal is known .
Accept the regards of your brother .

Doha -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres quoted the Prince of Qatar as saying the Islamic Resistance Movement -LRB- Hamas -RRB- would make peace if Israel would abandon the lands it occupied in the 1967 war .
Peres said he also discussed Iran 's nuclear ambitions with Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani , Prince of Qatar , during a rare visit to the American - allied Gulf country , his first in a decade .
" In his judgment , if Israel would go back to the borders of 1967 , Hamas would make peace with Israel , " Peres told reporters after the meeting .
" He -LRB- Sheikh Hamad -RRB- says Hamas was elected , and he thinks Hamas is more pragmatic than we think . "
Peres said about the Hamas movement , which won the Palestinian elections in 2006 and refuses to recognize the Jewish state , " I told him that Hamas has refused to meet .
Hamas has announced it will not recognize the signed agreements between us and the Palestinians . "
Israel " should , pay so much attention to their declarations , as they have to please another audience , " he reported Sheikh Hamad as saying in the meeting , which lasted for one hour , and which he described as " frank and amiable . "
Peres said the talks also addressed Iran 's nuclear program .
He said Israel would back increased " economic pressure and a psychological campaign " against the government of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who is a sworn enemy of Israel .
" I do not think Israel has a problem with Iran ; it has a problem with Ahmadinejad , " Peres said .
Peres said that there is " a great deal of dissatisfaction inside Iran " with the policies of Ahmadinejad .
" You can not feed your children enriched uranium for breakfast . You need something more than that , " he added .
Iran 's neighbors in the Gulf expressed their concern over Iran 's nuclear plans , and Saudi officials said that an Iran which owns nuclear weapons could spur a regional arms race .
Peres was the most senior Israeli official to visit Doha in 1996 when he opened a trade office in the country .
There are no official diplomatic relations with Qatar .
Qatar and several other Arab countries ended an economic ban on Israel after it signed interim peace agreements with the Palestinians in 1993 , but relations deteriorated after the outbreak of the uprising in 2000 .

Esseri .
A crisis and what a crisis ...
In general , I believe they will look for any justification in order to attract the likes of Peres in a way that facilitates his attendance and presence .
It is ok also if that lecture story is used , as long as it achieves the goal .
Sufficient unto us is God , and He is the best supporter .

It 's with Wednesday , March 5 2003 .
I 'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington .
Is the U.S. going to war ?
If you listen to the from 's men it sounds like the battle is about to begin , maybe only days from now .
America 's top diplomat laid out the case for war .
Secretary of State Colin Powell acted like a prosecutor , pointing out Iraq 's failures .
Over at the Pentagon , the military leaders say that troops are ready to fight right now even as they await word of the President 's order , but there is major opposition today , France , Germany and Russia plan a showdown at Theupups in a bid to stop the U.S. 's war machine and their voices of dissent echoed by protestors from Australia to Egypt to university students right here in the United States .
Even the Vatican voiced concerns today .
Later this hour I 'll speak exclusively to Cardinal Pio Laghi , the man dispatched by Pope John Paul II to persuade President Bush to avoid war , but we begin with reports from the United Nations , the Pentagon and the White House .
First to Chris Burns with news on the President and the Secretary of State who switched from diplomacy to talk of war .
Chris ?

Our French Nanny
-LRB- Chou Chin - cheng / tr. Scott Williams -RRB-
When my wife 's company sent her to Paris to work , we did n't think that our daughter , then just over a year old , would have any problems with attending school there .
Little did we imagine a colleague would inform us that her daughter had been " surrounded and attacked " by a group of young French children on her first day of pre-school .
The incident frightened her so badly that she would n't let her daughter go back to school .
If that was the case , my wife and I had a serious problem on our hands .
What could we do with Chien - chien if she was going to be viewed as a " little foreigner " and be bullied at school every day ?
The only solution seemed to be to have her learn French .
That way , if we ended up in court , at least she would n't have to stand there mute .
And so we hired Martine , a Frenchwoman in her 50s , to be Chien - chien 's nanny .
My wife truly treasures Chien - chien , and was not at all comfortable with the idea of leaving her with someone else .
First , we had no idea what kind of person Martine was .
We knew only that she was a licensed nanny with documents from the French government , and hiring her to look after Chien - chien seemed better than hiring a cheaper unlicensed nanny .
Second , Chien - chien understood no French , so we were concerned that she might be mistreated .
We could n't have guessed that Martine would treasure her just as much as my wife does .
And Martine knew how to handle children !
My wife and I thank Heaven for her .
I remember the first day we took Chien - chien to Martine 's place .
My wife and Chien - chien played out an extended farewell scene before finally tearfully parting .
And her father ?
Although I understood no French in those days , I was prepared to spend the whole day with Chien - chien .
I wanted to convey to Martine the idea that " if you beat the dog , you 'd better be prepared to deal with the master . "
But in spite of my resolution , within ten minutes , with Martine gesturing and Chien - chien sobbing , I was hustled out the door .
At first , I thought I had better stand outside and " keep an eye on things , " but then I realized that that would n't accomplish anything , and I made my dejected way home .
Later Martine told my wife that I had had to leave unless I wanted to spend my entire life holding Chien - chien 's hand .
It took Martine to remind us that short , sharp pains are better than long , drawn - out suffering .
At the outset , we were concerned that Chien - chien would n't like French food , so we prepared a lunchbox for her everyday and delivered it with her to Martine .
But every evening , her lunchbox came back untouched .
Was n't she eating ?
Thinking , " If this continues , she 'll starve to death , " we confronted Martine .
Confronted , Martine calmly informed us that Chien - chien could n't spend her entire time in France eating the lunchboxes we prepared .
And , she continued , since that was the case , why not get Chien - chien used to eating French food as soon as possible ?
Furthermore , she informed us that her own nutritious homemade meals would help Chien - chien grow .
She was even planning to prepare a " dinner box " for Chien - chien to bring home in the evenings .
Our " confrontation " turned into an abject apology !
One day , Martine mentioned to us that Chien - chien was a little cross-eyed .
However , she said we were not to worry because children 's eyes usually correct themselves as they get older .
To ease our minds , she had already taken Chien - chien to see her uncle , an ophthalmologist .
If Chien - chien would visit him again four or five times at two - week intervals , everything would be fine .
When we asked her about the fee , she would only say that it should n't be much .
In fact , she never did tell us .
Usually , nannies view sick children as an annoyance because they require more care , and often must be given medication .
As a result , most nannies expect that a child 's family will take care of it when it is sick .
But Martine was different .
When the weather turned cool and Chien - chien came down with a fever , Martine called my wife to offer to keep Chien - chien for the night .
She told my wife that she had been a nurse and that taking Chien - chien home in the cold night air might worsen her chill .
My wife , who had been hoping to take care of our sick daughter herself when she got home from work , naturally declined her kind offer .
In this way , we became more and more comfortable -LRB- and more and more grateful -RRB- having Martine as Chien - chien 's nanny .
I think Martine treated Chien - chien just as if she were her own child .
Our daughter is now three years old and attends a pre-school near our home .
Chien - chien 's teacher has told my wife that Chien - chien 's French is very good .
Perhaps because our little " foreigner " now speaks French , she gets along very well with her classmates ; they all remember her French name , Elodie , and let her know that I 'm there when they see me coming to pick her up after school .
We owe all of this to Martine .
We were lucky to find someone so skilled in the art of being a nanny .
She helped us so much .
Thank you , Martine !

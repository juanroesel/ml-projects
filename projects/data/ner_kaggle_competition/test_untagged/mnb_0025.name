We have an update tonight on this , the volcano in Mexico , they call El Popo .
Just 24 hours after its first erruption in more than 1,000 years , the worst appears to be over , but there is still the possibility of great danger to the tens of thousands of people who live nearby .
Our report on this tonight from Kevin Tibbles .
As the sun rises over Mt. Popo tonight , the only hint of the fire storm inside , whiffs of smoke , but just a few hours earlier , the volcano exploding spewing rock and red - hot lava .
The fourth largest mountain in North American , nearly 18,000 feet high , erupting this week with its most violent outburst in 1200 years .
They say it is an especially dangerous volcano because it of its steep slopes .
It could potentially wipe out everything in its path .
40,000 people live in the path .
Here at the National Natural Disaster Prevention Center , they are working around the clock .
It is here they take the volcano 's pulse , calling it unstable , saying Popo is simply recharging , getting ready to erupt again .
It 's acquiring more pressure , and eventually this pressure will be released in the -- in the future days .
The danger ?
The heat from Popo 's lava flow is melting the flashiers on the -- glaciers on the sides of the mountain and could trigger mud slides .
It 's like concrete coming down instead of water .
So , they will destroy anything in its -- that tries to stop them .
The Mexican government is taking no chances .
It sent out 1,000 troops to force an evacuation inside an eight - mile radius .
Tonight , 20,000 people in shelters , but another 20,000 refuse to leave , worried about their corn harvests who -- or who would feed their animals .
If a major danger was to come , says this man , then we 've got to run .
There 's no other choice .
Scientists say Popo has a huge crater about half a mile across , about 300 feet deep and a lava dome is building up like an upside - down grapefruit .
In contrast , Mt. Saint Helen had a dome , almost as if it was pregnant .
Randy White , who has done on - site studies of this mountain , monitors the rhythms .
It is blowing in its own way .
It could get bigger .
We do n't know how to predict it exactly .
For centuries here , the people have had almost a mystical relationship with Popo , believing the volcano is a god , showering their crops with rain .
Tonight , they fear it will turn vengeful , bringing destruction after 1200 years of peace .

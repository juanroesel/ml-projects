yeah ?
I think .
Mom does n't have one does she ?
No , I do n't think so .
mhm .
%um , Lori , I 'm trying to figure out my plans .
I still have no idea what I 'm doing when I get to Israel
and nothing has worked out
but I 'm still coming .
You 're kidding .
No , I 'm serious .
But I 'm still coming .
did you ever %um get in touch with %uh
I had given you the the other the fax of the number of the girl in %uh
You mean the
y- %um yeah
well I I I did fax them a letter .
It was little bit after that date like maybe a week later .
yeah ?
I faxed them a letter
and I never heard from them .
And I had and I ha-
I ba- basically
what she kind of said is you know come and we 'll talk sort of thing .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
so basically the one
okay
the well Interns For Peace retracted their offer because they decided I was n't enthusiastic enough .
Who 's this ?
%um Interns For Peace ?
mhm .
Like they had offered me a place
and then they took it back .
But did n't you also say you you were still were n't that keen on them ?
Right ,
I was n't
but I still would have rather rejected them than have them reject me .
yeah .
yeah
And then %um and then the next place which I was so hopeful about was was %um Moden Nisan
yeah
yeah
That thing at Haifa with %eh the Young Women 's Leadership Program .
yeah ?
And the woman made it sound so promising
and I waited two months to hear back
mhm .
And then I had n't heard from her
and it was after the date
so I called
mhm .
And she said oh I was going to fax you this evening
%um you know we 're not really sure what 's happening .
The position may be being redefined
%eh .
And then a week later , she called me and left a message saying oh you know they had all these things on the burner
and r- I should really look someplace else because they do n't know what 's going on
and
%hm .
And so th- I had really stopped looking for things because he made it sound so promising and like it was going to be almost fulltime .
%hm .
And then That 's a shame . And then it you know so instead it and now it 's like you know maybe a ten hour a week position
and it requires fluent Hebrew
and it 's just totally different than what we had talked about .
That 's a shame
And so then , meanwhile , Giva - Haviva had offered me a a very short term parttime internship
yeah ,
you mentioned
by writing up something to
yeah
like helping with grant writing and miscellaneous things and living on a nearby kibbutz maybe is it Ma'anit ?
%hm .
You could be even living at David 's and Savia 's and get to Giva - Haviva .
yeah ,
but it might be nice to be on the kibbutz because then I would get to know some people .
yeah .
yeah
But anyway ,
so then %ah
but that was three months ago that they offered me that
and you know who knows if they found someone
so I faxed them about a week and a half ago .
yeah .
mhm .
And I had n't heard back from them
and so I I called the New York office
and she said she 'd get back to me probably you know yesterday or today , as soon as she could talk with them .
%hm .
mhm .
Because maybe they found someone ,
I do n't know .
yeah .
So that 's
I 'm I 'm really hoping that that would work out you know ,
it 's just something
yeah .
But if not I mean I 'm just coming anyway
but I have no idea like where I 'll go
When are you planning on coming ?
And
Sometime either like mid to late September or early October .
mhm . mhm .
%um
Because I 'm thinking that I 'd like to stop in Europe on the way and visit some friends .
I have a friend in Spain and a friend in France and a and a friend in Germany

In other news today , the annual Christmas migration is under way from every part of the country , and many other parts of the world .
People are trying to reach their people somewhere else .
New York 's La Guardia Airport has been a nightmare this year , but there is some good news .

At Chicago 's O'Hare Airport , ground zero for air travel troubles all year -- there was a holiday surprise .
220,000 passengers jammed the airport , but with good weather and labor peace at United Airlines , there were few delays .
We 're actually on time today .
A rare thing that happens here .
Reporter :
There were scattered delays in Philadelphia , New York and Boston .
Snow fell all day long in the Northeast , causing poor visibility , but little stayed on the ground .
Across the country , skies were clear at almost every major airline hub and little change is expected tomorrow , which was particularly welcome at Atlanta 's Hartsfield Airport .
Earlier this week , bad weather added to a labor dispute between Delta Airlines and its pilots caused scores of cancellations and hundreds of delays .
Still , Delta said it was forced to cancel 5 % of its flights today , because some pilots refused overtime .
This journey started at 6:45 a.m. , and it does n't look like there 's any promise of getting out of here tonight .

Which may explain why so many , almost 45 million people , are traveling by car this weekend , up sharply from last year .
And few problems are reported .

Amtrak is expected to have more passengers too .
I take the train because it 's a lot more sane than flying .

What Price Public Art ?
-LRB- Tsai Wen - ting / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
The art market in Taiwan has tended to focus on oil painting and ink - and - wash , with relatively little interest in sculpture , photography , ceramics and multimedia .
However , tens of millions of NT dollars have now become available for work in a range of forms , under the provisions of a 1992 law requiring at least one percent of the budget for major infrastructure projects to be spent on public art .
As a result , artists from Taiwan and abroad have been scrabbling for a slice of the public art pie .
In Taipei , 1997 was designated as the Year of Public Art , and the following year experimental installations went on display at nine cultural centers around the island , chosen by the Council for Cultural Affairs -LRB- CCA -RRB- .
1998 also saw the adoption of new measures governing the installation of such works .
As public art began to proliferate , university departments of art , environment and architecture , spurred by demand , began offering public art courses .
Golden opportunity
The development of a number of major infrastructure projects , including the Taipei MRT system , the Second Northern Freeway and the new terminal at CKS Airport , released millions - even hundreds of millions - of NT dollars for spending on public art , creating a golden opportunity for eager artists .
During 1999 , 30 works of public art were completed in line with official provisions , at a cost of NT$ 40 million .
But the budget for yet - to - be - installed works is even more staggering : NT$ 100 million for public art at the new CKS Airport terminal alone , NT$ 85 million for spending by the Kaohsiung port authority , and NT$ 80 million for stations along the Wanhua - Panchiao branch of Taipei 's MRT network .
At a time of bleak economic prospects , public art commissions have become a beacon for artists .
No wonder some prefer to enter public art contests rather than accept the honor of selection committee membership .
The fact that the contest for nine works to be placed along Taipei 's " Tunhwa Art Corridor , " organized by Taipei 's Urban Development Department , drew entries from over 130 artists , shows how intense the competition can be .
And it is sculptors who have been the biggest beneficiaries of the new policies , since three - dimensional art is the most suitable form for installation in open spaces : of the 55 public art works completed in 1998 , 40 were works of sculpture .
Art engineering ?
At present , public art is chosen through one of four methods : open competition , invitation to tender , commissioning , and direct purchase .
The process has to involve a selection committee from the CCA or relevant cultural department at the local level , comprising artists , architects , landscape designers , art educationalists and so on .
The committee appraises works for artistic quality , suitability for the location , safety and feasibility .
Entries which pass the first round are presented for public demonstration and discussion among the community , so as to avoid subsequent protests .
Unlike those working with other forms of art , the creators of public art need to have a grasp of architectural structure , environmental scenery and even accounting procedure .
Artistic conception alone is not enough .
They will be submitting expenditure claims and dealing with issues including long - term maintenance and cleaning , and maybe utility supply .
A number of artists have thus found it helpful to pool their talents , setting up workshops geared chiefly to the production of public art .
Priceless art ?
Transparency and professionalism in the public art selection process should be beneficial to the overall art environment in Taiwan .
But Huang Wen - ching , a number of whose works have been successfully selected , points out that artists still have to overcome frequent misunderstandings , such as when the cost of their material

Freezing the moments : Days When We are Busy Gathering .
Freezing the moments
Seeing the Year of the Dog going by one day after another and the Spring Festival approaching , we are busy greeting the advent of the " golden pig " and busy gathering with colleagues , friends and schoolmates .
We two have had no time virtually to have a quiet dinner at home ever since last week .
It was often deep night when we were back home !
Tutu went to a regular monthly gathering at the club again today .
I learned from his call that many people were there this time and even some of Hali 's friends went .
Brother Jia will go back to Germany on Friday .
They say we should be really high , and it seems god knows when we will be back home !
I can not be idle either and directly went to the department store to enjoy myself !
LYSH will be off on his/her home leave from tomorrow and wo n't be back until after the Spring Festival .
He/She can rest for more than a month altogether .
How envious I am !
I would laugh to death if I could have such long vacation each year !

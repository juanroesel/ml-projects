The shock waves rushed across the country .
In Washington , where the Gore campaign had steeled themselves to lose , in Texas , where Bush and his team were convinced Democrats on the Florida Supreme Court were determined to win this one for Mr. Gore .
Mr. Bush 's lawyers are rushing to the Supreme Court of the United States for assistance .
There was no major reaction on Wall Street .
Markets had closed .
Everywhere else in the country , Americans were stopped momentarily in their tracks to think of the mess that may lie ahead .
First question , how can Florida count the votes in 64 counties when it took this much to get a partial count in three ?
Let 's go back to ABC 's Erin Hayes .
Peter , here in the capital they are just about ready to go .
In Tallahassee in a courthouse , , 000 votes from Miami - Dade County .
Those votes there had been preparations just in case .
If we use 25 teams , then that roughly adds up to little less than 500 ballots per team , and we figure we could probably conclude that within an eight - hour time .
But then , for the rest of the state , some counties have n't separated the undervotes from the rest of the ballots .
Where to start ? and what to count ?
There was almost no guidance from the court on how to do it .
In tabulating what constitutes a legal vote , the standard to be used is the one provided by the legislature .
A vote shall be counted where there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter .
Exactly the kind of ambiguity that has kept the legal battle muddy and ongoing for 31 days .
We do n't know what the standards will be .
We do n't know who will count them .
We do n't know whether or not she will be counted in time for them to count in the Electoral College .
The court was deeply divided .
Judge Wells said -- the concern among many is that this decision now leads so many questions .
T. would appear very little time to find the answers .
Thanks .

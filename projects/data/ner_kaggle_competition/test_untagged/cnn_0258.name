Today 's battles include pictures of the oil field fires in southern Iraq .
Firefighters continue their work at the Ramallah oil field .
Officials say they capped one blaze , leaving only two wells still burning out of 500 oil fields in the area .
They say some Iraqis who worked in the field before the war already are asking for their jobs back .
And these pictures show Iraqis running for cover just before U.S. planes dropped a bomb near northern Iraq .
Just as they disappear over the ridge , you can hear the planes and the explosions and then you see the cloud .
Ask any American Marine and they 'll tell you they 'll do anything possible to recover the bodies of fallen comrades .
That grim task was carried out by Marines engaged in the fierce battle for the city of Nasiriyah Nasiriyah .
Aless So Vinci is there with the Marines .

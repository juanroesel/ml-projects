As for the animals , when it comes to genetically engineered animals , the law 's having an even tougher time keeping pace with science .
A U.S. company is seeking government permission to bring genetically altered fish to America 's kitchens .
Kevin Newman reports from a Canadian province .
For as long as they 've told stories , fishermen on this Canadian island province have shared tales of their catch .
Lobster in recent years , but not too long ago , another delicacy -- salmon .
Oh , yeah , we used to get salmon in the spring , but we do n't see it anymore .
I think they are pretty well wiped out .
But only two miles away , Atlantic salmon are thriving , and that 's an understatement .
These experimental salmon are on the cutting edge of the debate over genetically engineered food because a company has found a way to make the bigger one use growth hormone more efficiently .
It reaches full size faster .
How old is this fish ?
You 're looking at 2 1 / 2 years .
How old is this fish ?
Same age .
It is up to the Food and Drug Administration to decide if these will be the first genetically engineered beings to make it to your dinner table .
But is that agency also capable of judging what impact it may have on other species ?
Senior government wildlife experts have their doubts .
I think it 's asking more of the FDA than it should be asked to turn it into a wildlife agency .
The FDA says it has hired experts in the field , but unlike wildlife agencies , the FDA keeps its research and evaluations secret from the public .
Laws do stipulate that there are certain types of material that we need to hold in confidence .
Which worries some who think it 's important people know if creating supersalmon to feed human appetites could threaten normal salmon .
We have shown they have a tremendous potential to upset the balance of nature .
The company producing the supersalmon says it can solve that problem by engineering fish that never mate , but the balance of nature grows more complicated and controversial , the deeper man explores the power of creation .

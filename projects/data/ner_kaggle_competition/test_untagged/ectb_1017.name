Home Is Where the Heart Is Community Activism in a Small Hakka Town

Last year 's earthquake may have de-stroyed families and toppled homes , but it also brought people closer together and created new links between local communities .
This has especially been the case with Peipu -LRB- Hsinchu County -RRB- and Shihkang -LRB- Taichung County -RRB- .
These two rural towns are alike in many ways .
Each is predominantly Hakka , each is located in north - central Taiwan , and each has about 10,000 inhabitants .
Since last year , however , there has been one huge difference -
the earthquake decimated Shihkang but left Peipu virtually unscathed .
The earthquake killed more people in Shihkang than any other township in Taiwan , and Shihkang remains largely in ruins a half year later .
Peipu , in the meantime , enjoys a booming tourist industry that just keeps growing .
Since the earthquake , Peipu 's Ta Ai Community Affairs Center -LRB- TCAC -RRB- has lent sustained assistance to Shihkang in a remarkable display of how a disaster can bring out the best in people .
" Donations and volunteers came flooding in immediately after the earthquake , " says Shihkang mayor Hsieh Chen - ying , " but we all knew that it would n't last for long .
The task of rebuilding is the hard part .
It 's going to take a long time . "
The city of Taipei " adopted " Shihkang after the earthquake , assigning personnel from its various ward offices to stay on long - term in Shihkang and assist with earthquake recovery .
Mighty Taipei , however , is joined in this task by Peipu 's TCAC , which is among the few organizations that have provided continuous assistance ever since the quake .
Peipu lends a helping hand
Says Shu Shih - wei , director of TCAC , " There is just so much to do after a disaster of this magnitude .
TCAC and the people of Peipu have only got so many resources . "
In the little community of Peipu , TCAC managed to collect three truckloads of relief supplies and over NT$ 400,000 after the earthquake .
In order to put it to the best possible use , they toured the disaster area several times and decided to devote all their energies to help the recovery effort in the township of Shihkang in Taichung County .
The two towns are not so far apart - about two hours by car .
Besides their common ethnicity , the seriousness of the damage in Shihkang was a major reason why TCAC chose to concentrate on Shihkang .
Shihkang is located on the banks of the Tachia River , and was one of the areas most heavily hit by the quake , with 178 deaths , over 1,200 buildings totally destroyed , more than 500 homes partially destroyed , and dozens of historic old structures demolished .
TCAC had already been active in community development efforts in Peipu , and its members knew from this experience that rebuilding from the earthquake would take a long time , so they set up Shihkang Work Station at Tuniu Elementary School in late October and made plans to stay for a year .
Shihkang Newsletter
The main task of the Work Station is to publish the fortnightly Shihkang Newsletter .
The first edition of this one - page newsletter went out last November 8th .
It reports on everyday life in the disaster area and matters related to the recovery effort .
TCAC 's Li Chieh - ying has been working full - time at the Shihkang Work Station since November .
According to Li , the newsletter is extremely important to people in the disaster area for a couple of reasons .
Firstly , it enables people to share information .
People can see that they are not alone in their suffering , and that they must address their situation from a collective standpoint instead of chasing after individual problems one at a time .
Secondly , people in the disaster area need information from the outside world , and now that the news media have shifted their attention to other matters , the local people need an avenue by which to get their message out to the rest of the world .
The newsletter is just the thing to accomplish these objectives .
This newsletter has also helped to spur increased contact between the people of Peipu and Shihkang .
According to Li Chieh - ying , they distribute 3,000 copies of the Shihkang Newsletter in Shihkang , 500 in Tungshih and Shinshe , and 1,000 in Peipu , which enables the people of Peipu to truly get a feel for what is needed in the disaster area .
By sending a person to serve full - time at the Shihkang Work Station , TCAC has managed to quickly integrate itself into the local community in Shihkang , and to see where assistance is most urgently needed .
The children of Shihkang , for example , are in especially great need of psychological counseling , so TCAC asked the Hsiuh - li Liuh Memorial Foundation to provide therapy for children and teachers .
In addition , the Shihkang Work Station is also helping to build prefab shelters .
The Far Eastern group only donated 50 prefab units , and people in less than privileged situations -LRB- such as renters and those living in illegally constructed residences -RRB- were not even eligible to apply for them , so TCAC has been working hard to put up prefab units for the residents of Tzu - yun Lane .
Several old residences collapsed there , causing numerous deaths and injuries .
The work on the prefab units has been a race against time , for as Shu Shih - wei points out , some people in the disaster area have died of cold over the winter .
To survive the great earthquake only to die because of an inadequate relief effort seems the height of injustice .
A non-Hakka in Peipu
How has TCAC managed to deliver such steady assistance to people in the disaster area ?
What do they have that sets them apart ?
It all has to do with their experience with community activism in Peipu .
You wo n't find the name Ta Ai on a map of Hsinchu County , for it is an administrative division not of the ROC government , but of the famous Yimin Temple of northern Hsinchu .
The Ta Ai area encompasses the three townships of Peipu , Paoshan , and Omei .
Yimin Temple commands the allegiance of Hakka faithful in 15 different temple districts , of which the Ta Ai district is one .
Peipu Township lies immediately southwest of the town of Chutung , and is surrounded by mountains .
Over 95 % of its roughly 12,000 residents are Hakka .
Located in the center of Peipu is Tzu - tien Temple , the town 's main landmark , and the bustling streets that run past the temple offer the best shopping and eating in town .
TCAC operates out of an office in the middle of town .
The traditional architecture of the building is a very pleasant sight .
Shu Shih - wei , the key mover and shaker at TCAC , was born to parents from the mainland and grew up in Kaohsiung .
Formerly a professor at Chung Yuan Christian University , he first came to Peipu ago to help a colleague study the local architecture .
Shu 's role in the project was to study the sociology of Peipu and gain a clear understanding of life in a small Hakka town .
Shu ended up staying on in Peipu after the project came to an end , and today he serves as director of TCAC .
Says Shu , " Now I can understand about 60 - 70 % of what people say in Hakka ! "
How it all started
TCAC was established almost by accident .
After settling in Peipu , Shu gradually put down roots in the local community and made friends .
In the summer of 1996 , Shu and a few women got to talking about education and they hatched an idea to set up an after - school study center .
The local Catholic church donated space for the center , and the project was soon launched .
They also set up a small library , and local residents generously donated many books .
Thanks to the center , a group of concerned local citizens started seeing each other quite frequently , and they ended up establishing Ta Ai Community Affairs Center in March 1997 .
They chose Chiang Yi - sen , the owner of a local dry goods store , as the chairman , and selected Shu as director .
The new organization resolved to work toward the achievement of four goals : " A better standard of living , in both the material and spiritual sense .
Preservation and development of Hakka culture .
Preservation of the environment and development of local industry .
Development of community education for people of all ages . "
After TCAC was officially established , its main project was the publication of a bimonthly newsletter .
The TCAC Newsletter provided the people of Peipu with an opportunity to speak their minds on such issues as preservation of local streams , their love for their hometown , and various local affairs .
Pitching in
A young man wrote in the TCAC Newsletter , " I used to have a job in another town , and every time I came back to Peipu I would go straight to the noodle shop and wolf down a bowl of bantiao noodles even before stopping to say hello to my parents .
Until I had eaten a bowl of bantiao , I did n't feel like I was back home yet . "
According to Shu Shih - wei , keeping the newsletter in print for two or three years has been no small accomplishment .
" These people do n't write for a living .
A person might spend four or five hours writing up a short little article . "
In addition to the newsletter , TCAC has also been involved in many local activities .
" A lot of interesting stuff goes on in a small Hakka town , " says Shu , adding that when help is needed the locals are likely to contribute not just money but something even more valuable - their time and energy .
When TCAC puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water .
When a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience .
" If the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says Shu , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations .
That is why TCAC has been able to carry out so many activities over the past three years without spending any money .
Peipu residents have taken part enthusiastically in recycling campaigns , flea markets , and post-harvest yam roasts , and events of this nature have even drawn participants from out of town .
According to Chiang Yi - sen , when TCAC organized a camping trip last year , participants from Chutung , Toufen , and elsewhere actually outnumbered the locals .
We miss our walkways !
Thanks to the energy and dedication of nine regular staff and many enthusiastic volunteers , TCAC has managed to make a difference in this small Hakka township over the past three years .
Most notably , the people of Peipu have begun to sense the value of what they 've got in their community .
The campaign to beautify Peipu 's Hsia Street is an excellent case in point .
Seven years ago , in order to ease the problem of increasing traffic congestion , the township widened Hsia Street .
The project required demolition of all the covered walkways that used to stand outside the stores there .
It seemed like a laudable move toward modernization at the time , but people living along the street came to rue the loss of their covered walkways .
Cars came roaring down in great numbers along the widened street , while the residents lost the space in front of their homes where they had once enjoyed many a leisurely hour .
According to Chiang Yi - sen , whose store is located on Hsia Street , everybody used to congregate in the cool shade of the walkways in the summer .
Neighbors were more involved with each other , and his two children always had a place to play .
Now that the covered walkways have been replaced by parking spaces , people scarcely leave their homes .
The old folks stay inside watching television , while the young people only emerge briefly on their way to work .
People rarely have a chance to speak to each other anymore .
Fortunately , the people of Peipu quickly realized their mistake .
Last year TCAC applied to the Council for Cultural Affairs for authorization to carry out a campaign to beautify Hsia Street .
The residents did everything they could to restore something of their former neighborhood .
They erected street lamps and put out benches where people could sit and chat , and have succeeded in creating a very friendly atmosphere .
The gaily lit Hsia Street seems almost to have returned to an earlier time .
It might be impossible for Hsia Street to ever be exactly the same as it once was , but the beautification campaign taught the people of Peipu the value of what they have .
When the town hall made plans to rip up the stone steps on the long pathway leading up the mountainside at Hsiuluan Park and replace them with imported stone , local citizens protested , asking the town hall to leave the steps as they were .
In the end they succeeded in keeping part of the steps untouched .
States Chiang with a sigh , " There 's not much left that 's really worth passing on to our grandchildren .
We ca n't keep destroying things . "
Do you remember ?
The scope of TCAC activities is not limited to improving the quality of old neighborhoods .
The organization is also active in the effort to preserve the local environment .
Shu Shih - wei points out that for an agricultural community like Peipu , streams are an indispensable resource .
Aquatic life on Taping River , however , is dwindling due to destruction of the surrounding environment and excessive gravel mining on the river bed .
Last April , over 50 people from the townships of Peipu and Omei organized the TCAC Taping River Preservation Team .
In addition to holding meetings throughout the local area to show slides and publicize the river 's plight , the River Preservation Team also posted notices on the riverbank in May asking locals and out - of - town visitors not to poison or electrocute fish or catch them in nets .
The team also goes out occasionally to pick up trash and patrol the river .
Besides these activities , TCAC also offers regularly scheduled classes for both children and adults .
Current offerings include a class on environmental preservation for children , while for both children and adults there are classes on calligraphy , traditional Hakka folk songs , and local history .
Every Wednesday evening you can hear the strains of Hakka folk songs coming from TCAC .
The youngest participants in the class are just seven or eight , while the oldest range on up to 70 or 80 .
Every one of the lilting melodies carries with it a nugget of Hakka culture .
Even more interestingly , the teacher makes up lyrics about the river preservation campaign and sets them to traditional folk melodies , thus melding the old and the new .
In the class on local history , the participants themselves do all the talking .
They exchange stories about the past and talk about places whose names no longer even appear on the maps .
Everyone works in this way to call up a collective memory of local history .
Says Shu Shih - wei , " By sharing our experiences we can get everybody to take an active interest in the changes that are taking place in the local community . "
Outgrowths of the class include the river preservation campaign and a guidebook for tourists interested in learning about environmental issues and local history .
Says Shu , " Forget about all the high - falutin' talk about ' urban redevelopment ' and whatnot - everyone cares about what goes on in their town .
But you 've got to find a way to get everybody working together so you can actually get something done , otherwise all talk about local affairs wo n't amount to anything more than people doing a bit of idle chatting and complaining around the dinner table . "
Hard times , warm hearts
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September .
After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters .
In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .
At a New Year 's celebration in Peipu , Shihkang mayor Hsieh Chen - ying gave the people of Peipu a gift as a token of gratitude for their generous assistance , and when TCAC board members traveled to Shihkang to inspect the progress on the prefab shelters , they took advantage of the occasion to exchange views with local residents .
" I 'm very excited about the two - way channel of communication that we 've established , " says Li Chieh - ying , and he adds that this communication is a source of strength that has enabled the Shihkang Work Station to keep going .
The prefab units that TCAC helped build at Tuniu Elementary School were completed on February 28th , and Li Chieh - ying reports that the Shihkang Work Station is now concentrating primarily on gaining a clear picture of what is needed to get people back to work .
Although the original plan only calls for the Shihkang Work Station to operate for one year , Li Chieh - ying opines , " I have my doubts about whether we 'll actually be able to leave after a year . "
He feels that the cooperative relationship and emotional ties that have been forged between Peipu and Shihkang ought to be kept alive , and he hopes that the people of Ta Ai will be able to share their know - how in community activism with other localities so that Taiwan can recover the vibrant communities that it lost in the earthquake .

The people of Peipu have come to understand the value of their heritage , and have begun working to preserve old buildings .
In restoring old residences , they are eschewing modern building materials and using the methods of the past .

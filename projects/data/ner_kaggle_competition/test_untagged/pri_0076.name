A Chinese cancer patient has become something of a celebrity .
After doctors told Lu Yo Ching in August that he had three months to live , Lu began writing a diary on the internet .
Now , five months later , Lu has survived to see his cyber diary published as a book .
As the BBC 's Dunkin Humet reports , some Chinese readers are grateful for Lu 's writings but other find them offensive .
In the private ward of a Shanghai hospital Shu Mu Yeng is a perfect host , offering her visitors tea and chatting calmly .
In the next room her husband Lu Yo Ching lies sleeping in the final stages of cancer , exhausted both by the battle with the disease and by months of painful writing which have brought him both fame and criticism .
Shu Mu Yeng says he originally began his controversial diary as a purely personal concern .
Before he put it on the internet he started writing at home for our daughter .
As his illness developed he realized that in the future our daughter might lack the guidance of a father .
So I encouraged him to write something to leave for her .
But as he wrote the 37 - year - old former literature student , melon salesman , advertising executive and real estate manager decided he had feelings he wished to share with Chinese society at large .
He sought out a local web site , which agreed to publish sections of his writings on the internet .
Diary of Death , as it became known , affected many with its outspoken views , particularly Mr. Lu 's reflections on 6 years as a cancer sufferer in China .
From the moment you pick up a lab report stating that the doctor has diagnosed cancerous cells , life starts to get tough .
If you 're an official your career will stop dead .
The Personnel Department will start looking for your successor and people will start positioning themselves to replace you .
If you 're a businessperson your credit will suddenly be devalued .
Even husbands or wives will start making calculations about the future .
And if Chinese people 's attitude to cancer is a tragedy , writes Lu Yo Ching , the treatment of cancer patients in the medical system is like a black farce , high in cost but often ineffective .
He compares the country 's overcrowded cancer wards to a conveyor belt where the surgeons are skilled because they have so much practice that bribes are often necessary to get quick treatment .
Lu Yo Ching 's criticisms and his decision earlier this year to stop taking medication and stay out of hospital for as long as possible have provoked widespread debate .
His wife Shu Mu Yeng sighs as she describes the 10,000 e-mail messages in their in - box .
Many have been supportive and admiring but by no means all .
According to Inzer , an editor with a Shanghai based web - site many people feel that it 's not appropriate for a dying man to go so public with his views on his illness .
In Chinese people 's idea we have a tradition like we do n't talk to anybody about family things , especially some kind of unfortunate thing .
For lots of old people it 's very shocking .
Lu Yo Ching has freely admitted that he 'd be pleased if the book version of his diary earns some money to support his wife and daughter , yet his real interest is to provoke debate on life and how to live it .
Life when you 're sick tastes bitter , but it can also be fun if you 're lucky enough to master secrets on how to turn the bitter into fun .
Avoid all household chores .
This is the common objective of the Women 's Liberation Movement and the Men 's Epiphany Movement in China .
Always think about spending money but never think about earning it .
Never get into a quarrel with your family where you feel like you are the police and they are the common people .
Enjoy a fresh fruit in all four seasons and fresh flowers everywhere .
You do n't need to dress too properly .
Attractiveness lies in being a mess .
Never worry whether the battery will run out on your mobile phone .
And people will remember you if you do good things by chance .
Despite all the criticism and the media spotlight Lu Yo Ching 's wife Shu Mu Yeng says she believes that his decision to write the diary was a good thing .
Lots of people think that my husband 's actions could have a lot of negative consequences , but I say , ' Long live understanding . '
At least it has made people think about life , and that was my husband 's highest aim .

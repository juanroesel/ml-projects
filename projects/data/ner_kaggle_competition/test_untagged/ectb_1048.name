The winner of the prize for fine art in last year 's National Culture and Arts Foundation Awards - one of the highest honors for an artist in Taiwan - was contemporary painter Hsia Yang .
Hsia first became a leading light on the Taiwan art scene back in the 1950s , as one of the " Eight Great Outlaws " who launched the island 's modern art movement .
Since then his artistic vocation has taken him around the world , and he has at last ended up back in Taiwan .
What is it that distinguishes Hsia 's work and that marked him out for the National Arts and Culture award , and what kind of contribution has he made to contemporary art in Taiwan ?
Friendly and relaxed by nature , Hsia Yang does n't seem overly excited about winning the National Culture and Arts Award .
If anything it is his friends who are happiest , relieved to see Hsia gaining deserved recognition for the achievements of his peripatetic , ill - starred life .
Lonely start in life
Hsia Tzu - hsiang , as he was then named , was born into a literary family in Hunan Province .
Fate robbed him of his mother within a week of his birth , and of his father when he was just four .
His grandmother took him to Sichuan to escape the war , and they returned a couple of years later to find the family home in ruins .
When he was nine his grandmother died and he was entrusted to a great aunt .
She in turn died when Hsia was 13 , after which he went to live with an uncle and aunt in Hankou .
They wanted to send him to join his elder brother in Changsha , but his brother did n't have the means to take care of him either .
At the age of 16 , after years of being passed from pillar to post , Hsia joined the army - where at least he knew that he 'd get fed .
" It was a big clan , and it just fell apart ! " says Hsia with a rueful smile , the expression of one who has seen life and holds few illusions .
Hsia joined up in the year that the Nationalist forces retreated from the mainland , and soon found himself in a desk job at Air Force General HQ in Taiwan .
By coincidence , the dormitory bunk above his was occupied by another aspiring painter , Wu Hao .
The two became firm friends and began to take classes under Li Chung - sheng , the doyen of modern art in Taiwan .
At Li 's Antung Street Studio they teamed up with a group of like - minded young painters , including Ouyang Wen - yuan , Huo Kang , Hsiao Chin , Li Yuan - chia , Chen Tao - ming and Hsiao Ming - hsien .
Together they formed the Ton - Fan Group , and eventually they became known as the " Eight Great Outlaws " of Taiwanese modern art .
As Hsia recalls , the main incentive for studying under Li Chung - sheng was that Li 's fees were relatively affordable .
Other painters charged upwards of 45 yuan per month , with fees at studios run by older , more established Taiwanese artists reaching 60 or 70 yuan .
No amount of scrimping and saving was going to put that within reach of someone like Hsia , getting by on a military allowance of just 25 yuan per month .
The only choice was the Antung Street Studio , where the monthly fee was just 20 yuan .
Rescuing Chinese art
The economic constraints and repressive censorship of the era did nothing to deter these young art fiends .
As Hsia recalls , the only art materials they could get hold of were red and black ink , courtesy of the military , and pencils .
Sometimes they mixed the ink with glue to produce an oil - paint texture .
Scraping together the money for just one tube of oil paint involved considerable effort , and Hsia remembers repeatedly uncapping that single tube to breathe in the lovely scent of linseed oil .
The painters took turns taking off their shirts to model for each other , and Hsia would sometimes spend the whole day sketching customers at the ice - cream shop by the train station , after paying for a single slice of watermelon .
In 1955 , against the advice of their teacher and clueless about the risks involved in starting up a new organization -LRB- Taiwan was under martial law at the time -RRB- , the young artists formed themselves into the Ton - Fan Group .
People flocked to buy tickets for the exhibition that they mounted at a venue in Taipei 's Chunghua Road , but many visitors found that the art was not to their liking .
Some , feeling " cheated , " flung their exhibition leaflets on the floor in disgust .
" They cost 50 cents each to produce ! " exclaims Hsia , still bemoaning the waste .
Raising the banner of reform , the Outlaws issued a declaration forecasting Chinese art 's inevitable decline if it stayed stuck in the past .
Only through the introduction of modern forms of expression from the outside world , they said , could the boundless resources of China 's art tradition be revitalized .
The declaration , which Hsia drafted , shows that the group 's objective was to modernize Chinese art by drawing Western artistic concepts and methods into the production of essentially Chinese works .
This insistence on the " China " element has been a hallmark of Hsia Yang 's art ever since .
Outlaws around the world
From paintings of his done during that early period , one sees how Hsia rendered human figures using the thick lines of traditional Chinese folk painting , but proceeded to dissect and reassemble those figures in a Western , mechanistic fashion .
In his painting Flying Apsaras , Hsia brings a modern geometrical approach to the traditional image of airborne Buddhist spirits .
Critic Wang Chia - chi describes these divine beings shown wafting through a void of blank space as " kind of surreal . . . like astronauts in a state of weightlessness . "
Hsia has also produced a number of purely abstract works , drawing on his deep familiarity with that most important element of Chinese art - the use of line .
In 1955 Hsiao Chin went to study in Spain , becoming the first of the Ton - Fan Group to go overseas .
He wrote back to Taiwan describing the new trends in art that he was witness to , and the other painters , after poring over the contents of his densely written airmail letters , began putting some of those ideas into practice .
Taiwan was very cut off from the world in those days , and those studying art naturally wanted to see for themselves what was happening elsewhere .
In their letters to Hsiao , all the others , including their teacher Li Chung - sheng , asked about the cost of living overseas .
One by one , each member of the group set off on his own modern art pilgrimage to the West .
Hsia Yang , for whom France was the art center of the world , made his move in 1963 , traveling by ship from Keelung to Hong Kong and from there on to Europe .
The cost of his one - way ticket was borne by his colleague at Air Force HQ Chang Chuan - jen , who generously put his entire savings of NT$ 5,000 at Hsia 's disposal .
On the way to France Hsia stopped off in Milan to visit Hsiao Chin .
Hsia remembers that Hsiao 's first words on meeting were : " Come on , let 's paint . "
For someone like Hsia , orphaned early and shunted for years among various relatives , the support and affection of his friends has played a particularly important part in his life .
Fuzzy people , floating people
During his four - and - a - half years in Paris Hsia lived in a tiny garret in the red light district with barely enough room to stand up in .
He supported himself doing miscellaneous jobs , working on people 's houses and restoring furniture .
Times were tough , but it was during this period that he found what he had been probing for in his use of line , and started on the " fuzzy people " phase of his output .
Hsia 's fuzzy people were born into his work as if by a natural process .
While experimenting with a tangle of lines Hsia found unidentifiable clusters taking shape , from which human forms began to emerge .
" This was something I really knew I could work with , " recalls Hsia .
It was a case of " seizing that special thing of your own , " which for an artist is of the utmost importance .
Like a Taoist priest painting magic symbols , Hsia uses line to create human figures and the written word to invoke power .
With rapid , sweeping strokes of the brush he creates fluid , free - floating figures , without faces or personalities , performing their allotted roles in the midst of a coldly linear realm .
The resulting images reflect the alienation of modern life , conveying a sense of illusion and impermanence .
It has been suggested that Hsia Yang himself , the lifelong drifter , is the prototype for these blurry beings .
But then again , which of us is not in transit , drifting through this brief existence ?
" As the Chinese say , man is a passenger through life who is gone in an instant .
Hsia Yang 's fuzzy people exist very much within this Eastern philosophical context . "
So says Fu Shen , one of the judges in the fine arts category for the 2000 National Culture and Arts Foundation awards .
While he was in France Hsia received a letter from a friend in the US saying : " Life is easier here . "
Soon afterwards he moved to New York , renting a cheap loft in SoHo and supporting himself as a furniture restorer .
Photorealism was the vogue in American painting at the time .
It did n't appeal to Hsia at first , but he knew he had to learn something in his new country of residence , and at the same time he needed to produce work that was commercially viable .
He began employing photographic effects , for example depicting a crowd of passersby on a New York street as a speeding blur .
His work now became populated with " floating people " of this kind , although in spirit they were still the fuzzy people of his earlier period .
Hsia spent over 20 years in New York , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music .
The walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by Hsia in language that was part literary Chinese and part colloquial .
" I was like a Chinese person dwelling in a Chinese concession in New York , " says Hsia with a laugh .
The biggest boon of living in New York was that this was where Hsia met his wife Wu Shuang - hsi .
Wu had grown up in a contented home never knowing poverty , and held a PhD in philosophy .
She met Hsia through the painter Hsieh Li - fa , and since then the two of them have shared a simple and quiet life together .
" Feeling anxious when the old lady 's not here , and looking listlessly out the window / So bored of this dumb view , it 's much better when the silly little thing 's around . "
So runs one of Hsia 's light - hearted couplets , testifying to the affection that unites these two people who only came together relatively late in life .
Going home
Hsia returned to Taiwan in 1992 , after three decades away .
With a basic source of income guaranteed through an art - gallery contract , Hsia rented a spacious , light - filled three - story house in Peitou .
The new place was ideal for painting , but at NT$ 35,000 per month the rent was on the high side .
Hsia 's " silly little " wife was in tears when it came to signing the lease , worrying that eventually they would n't be able to afford the rent .
Luckily Professor Li Chih - wen of the National Institute of the Arts offered to support them to the tune of NT$ 10,000 per month for the first three years after their return to Taiwan , and Hsia and his wife were thus able to settle themselves down .
" At key moments , a little help from your friends can make all the difference , " says Hsia .
Financial help from his friends at such moments was what enabled Hsia to go abroad in the first place and then , eventually , to return again to Taiwan .
This is something that the reserved Hsia has frequent cause to think about .
After returning to Taiwan Hsia Yang reverted to painting fuzzy people .
Over the years , Hsia 's fuzzy people have taken on a number of different guises , be it as judges , singers , couples , beach babes or whatever .
They have mimicked famous icons of Western art such as the Mona Lisa , Millet 's The Gleaners , and Botticelli 's Venus , and now the fuzzy family includes well - known figures from the Chinese Buddhist pantheon , part of a series of works that examines the role of religion in people 's lives .
For Hsia Yang , all characters are fair game for inclusion in his work , and all of them end up reverting to nothingness .
Fuzzy people stand up
Why is Hsia so into " fuzzy people , " and has he ever thought about trying something else ?
The painter points out that he ca n't predict what direction he may follow in the future , and says that if a new theme or style emerges it will be through a natural process , like the one that first gave birth to the fuzzy people .
At the end of 2000 Hsia 's fuzzy people at last " stood up " for themselves , becoming sculptures rather than just images on paper .
Hsia was fiddling with an aluminum ring from a broken hair - dryer , shaping it into a little figure , when the idea dawned of doing fuzzy people in solid form .
By cutting and twisting pieces of copper , iron and steel , he was able to produce amusing little statuettes of his hitherto two - dimensional fuzzy people .
Hsia 's friends were not surprised by his move into sculpture , because he has always been good with his hands .
In New York he once made a hand - operated washing machine from a saucepan and several pieces of wood , and on another occasion he used the motor from an electric fan to power a self - adjusting easel .
In Hsia 's hands , all sorts of discarded objects , from sewing machines to camera lenses , are salvaged and put to good use .
" I 'm the Leonardo da Vinci of the Orient , " chuckles Hsia .
Returning East has brought Hsia back into contact with the other " Outlaws " who used to dominate the Taiwan art scene .
Of those , Chen Tao - ming has since given up art and gone into business , Li Yuan - chia passed away in Britain , and Ouyang Wen - yuan does n't paint any more because of psychological problems .
However , Hsiao Chin , Wu Hao , Huo Kang and Hsiao Ming - hsien are all still active .
At a reunion two years ago , Hsia declared proudly : " We 're the same merry band of rebels , still advancing as one ! "
For artists to produce outstanding work they have to immerse themselves utterly in the act of creation .
These painters , remaining committed to the " pure " creative spirit and thoroughly loyal to the cause of art , are still the same old " outlaws " that they ever were .

Tornadoes have hit the southern state of Alabama as rain , hail and snow continued to pound the United States .
Warren Beck is the Mayor of one hard hit Alabama town .
We are used to floods , our city 's been flooded two or three times and of course we are close to the Gulf where we 're used to hurricanes but we are kind of low , we 're a low city and we are not used to tornadoes .
At least five people were reported killed in Alabama , thirty injured when a series of twisters struck parts of the rural state .
Meanwhile , in the central United States from Texas in the south to the northern plains , North Dakota , hundreds of thousands of people remained without electricity .

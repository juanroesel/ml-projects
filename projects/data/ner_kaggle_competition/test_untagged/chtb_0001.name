The development of Shanghai 's Pudong is in step with the establishment of its legal system
Xinhua News Agency , Shanghai , February 10 , by wire -LRB- reporters Jinhu Xie and Chijian Zhang -RRB-
In recent years Shanghai 's Pudong has promulgated and implemented 71 regulatory documents relating to areas such as economics , trade , construction , planning , science and technology , culture and education , etc. , ensuring the orderly advancement of Pudong 's development .
Pudong 's development and opening up is a century - spanning undertaking for vigorously promoting Shanghai and constructing a modern economic , trade , and financial center .
Because of this , new situations and new questions that have not been encountered before are emerging in great numbers .
In response to this , Pudong is not simply adopting an approach of " work for a short time and then draw up laws and regulations only after waiting until experience has been accumulated . "
Instead , Pudong is taking advantage of the lessons from experience of developed countries and special regions such as Shenzhen by hiring appropriate domestic and foreign specialists and scholars , by actively and promptly formulating and issuing regulatory documents , and by ensuring that these economic activities are incorporated into the sphere of influence of the legal system as soon as they appear .
Precisely because as soon as it opened it was relatively standardized , China 's first drug purchase service center for medical treatment institutions , which came into being at the beginning of last year in the Pudong new region , in operating up to now , has concluded transactions for drugs of over 100 million yuan and has n't had one case of kickback .
Construction is a principal economic activity in developing Pudong .
These years there have been several hundred construction companies and over four thousand construction sites that have spread out all over this stretch of hot turf .
In order to standardize construction procedures and to guard against the emergence of disorderly phenomena , the new region 's management committee promptly announced a series of documents for standardizing the construction market in accordance with the relevant national regulations and the regulations of Shanghai Municipality , while accommodating the realities of Pudong 's development .
The documents include : management methods for bidding on construction projects ; a certain number of regulations for demolition and removal work ; implementation methods for fixing construction that violated regulations ; construction suggestions for communications installations and cable setups ; provisional methods for environmental management at construction work sites ; etc .
Essentially they are worked out to the point where every single link has clearly defined and specific regulations .
When a construction company enters the region , first the appropriate bureau delivers these regulatory documents , and afterwards there is a specialized contingent that carries out a supervisory inspection .
In spite of the fact that of the regulatory documents that the Pudong new region has formulated , some are relatively " crude " and some are still only provisional regulations awaiting step - by - step completion as they are put into practice , nevertheless , this kind of approach , with the legal system tightly coupled with economic and social activities , has received positive comments from domestic and foreign investors .
They believe that in coming to the Pudong new region to invest there is methodicalness and attention to rules in the handling of business , and interests can receive safeguards .

Democratic reformers are claiming victory in Saturday 's parliamentary elections in Serbia , the dominant republic of Yugoslavia .
Mr. Kostunica told Serbian television today that the election victory will allow the reformers to move swiftly to start building a democratic government in what he called a socially oriented market economy .
VOA 's Barry Wood reports from Belgrade that the elections come less than three months after Slobodan Milosevic was ousted from power when he lost to a reformer in a presidential election .
Reformist Democratic Opposition of Serbia , the DOS , proclaimed victory only hours after the polls closed .
Unofficial results suggest that the reformist coalition will obtain about 65 % and a clear majority in the 250 seat Serbian Parliament .
The Socialist Party of ousted strong man Slobodan Milosevic , appears to be getting 13 % of the vote and is likely to be the largest single party in the Parliament .
Vote counting continues with official results likely no sooner than late Sunday .
Voter turnout was about 60 % less than had been expected .
Reformist leader Zuan Jinjich , who is said to become Serbia 's Prime Minister , called the election a popular mandate for democracy and the free market economy .
He promises to bring Mr. Milosevic to justice and rid the police and judiciary of Milosevic loyalists .

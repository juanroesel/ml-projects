Welcome to Len Doof 's house in Adelaide , Australia .
That 's right .
All this is one man 's personal Christmas decoration .
It 's his annual Christmas display , and tens of thousands of people come to see the blinking , spinning , twirling lights and hear the holiday music .
There are more than 52,000 lights , all synchronized to Christmas carols .
It takes more than 10 1 / 2 miles of cable and wire to hook it all up , and 23 computers .
This is definitely a high - tech Christmas display .
Doof , who is an electrical engineer , says his vision for the display was ahead of its time .
I actually had a dream about it a long time ago , and dreamt up , you know , the chips to put in the computers to make it work , and that was 20 years ago , before chips were anything other than fish and chips .
Over the past 20 years , the display has gotten bigger and brighter , and Doof says this one is the biggest yet .
He spends long hours on his elaborate display .
He started working on it last March .
He pays careful attention to all the fine details .
Every year , he hand - paints about 30,000 of the tiny globes that decorate his home .
Doof says he goes to such extremes for one reason .
This is Christmas .
It 's my Christmas present to everybody .
It 's my Christmas present to myself , and by people coming to see it , that makes me very happy , and I hope I make them very happy .

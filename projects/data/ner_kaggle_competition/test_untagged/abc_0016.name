In Yemen today , Navy divers cut through the deck of the `` USS Cole '' to remove the last four sailors who died in the attack .
Their bodies will head home tomorrow .
On Capitol Hill today , senators were asking the general who sent the `` USS Cole '' into the port of Aden in Yemen , why he made that decision .
Here 's ABC 's John M Wethy .
The man who opened the door for American warships to use the port of Aden made no apologies today .
The refueling of that ship in Aden was my decision .
I want to be clear .
I pass that buck on to nobody .
The one question all of us keep hearing , Why Yemen ?
The threat conditions in Aden the specific threat conditions , were actually better than we had elsewhere .
General Zinni said all her ports , from the Suez Canal to the Persian Gulf , had their own problems , either credible terrorists threats , unstable governments , or harbors jammed with small boats , plus , the government of Yemen wanted better relations with the U.S. and had begun taking steps to control local terrorist activity , but improved relations , Zinni said , did not blind the U.S. to the risks .
I do n't want anyone to think we ever in any instance , anywhere , ever took a risk for the purpose of a better relationship with a country and put a soldier , sailor , airman or marine at risk for that reason .
Absolutely not .
Some Republican senators wondered why the `` Cole '' and other ships were not routinely taking the far safer approach of refueling at sea ?
I think I 'm hearing you say , `` we do n't have enough tankers to be sure that we could do that . ''
That 's my sense , Senator .
The general had one more troubling message .
Terrorists are getting smarter , using nastier weapons , and as long as they are willing to die in their attacks , it will be virtually impossible to stop them all .

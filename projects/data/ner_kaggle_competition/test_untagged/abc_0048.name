It will be a long time that it 's forgotten that Mr. Bush won this the way he did in the Supreme Court .
Yes , it took a while last night to sort out precisely what the court had decided by such a narrow margin .
It is case number 00949 , and it will be dissected for years to come .
Here 's ABC 's Jackie Judd .
The Supreme Court cleared the way for George W. Bush to become President by interpreting the principle of `` equal protection under the law '' in a way it had never done before .
Equal protection cases often deal with discrimination based on race .
Here , the court applied it to counting voters ' ballots .
It 's now become clear , that as a matter of federal law , there have to be reasonably uniform standards for collecting people 's votes and for interpreting those votes .
In fact , equal protection became the single issue this divided court could find a majority to support .
This was a stabilizing decision that restored order to a very chaotic situation .
And with that in mind , the justices -- in a highly unusual move -- said their ruling `` is limited to the present circumstances '' only , meaning it applies just to Bush v. Gore .
Not likely say , say many legal experts .
What they 've done now amounts to , what could be a very important general principle , and take it right back again immediately by saying , `` well , we do n't intend to enforce this in any other case . ''
Even those who support aspects of the ruling still expect it to affect many states with election laws similar to Florida .
That raises a host of new questions , not just about recounts , but about different voting machines and differences between one city and another city within the same state .
Even it raises questions about differences between citizens of different states .
This historic decision will certainly be remembered as the one that put a President in the White House , but it may also become a decision that expands the judiciary 's role in future elections as well .

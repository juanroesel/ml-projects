If nine caroling cats crooning Christmas classics does n't put you in the holiday mood , maybe nothing will .
Yes , it 's that time of year .
The Jingle Cats are back , and can be found just about anywhere .
They have cassettes and and their very own video , which is also out on DVD .
The man behind the music , creator Mike Spalla , says he owes it all to his cat , Cheesepuff , and her finely tuned vocal cords .
I was hired to do some Christmas music , and it was just `` Jingle Bells , '' and I brought my cat with me to the studio , and I was working on the song and the cat jumped up into the record booth and started meowing along , meowing to me .

Cheesepuff and friends first clawed their way onto the music charts in 1993 with the release of their `` meowy Christmas '' CD , featuring 20 classic Christmas hits .
It was such a success , the following year , the feline group released another holiday song collection , `` Here Comes Santa Claws . ''
Spalla says they have a following of some very unique fans .
There 's a certain kind of person that 's in tune with a cat .
They 're thoughtful .
They must be more intelligent or something .

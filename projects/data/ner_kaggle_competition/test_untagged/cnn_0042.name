New violence was reported in the West Bank and Gaza today , in spite of the U.S. - brokered cease - fire between Israel and the Palestinians .
The clashes took place as Yasser Arafat 's Palestinian Authority reaffirmed its commitment to the truce .
Israel is to withdraw its forces from several areas over the next two days , and an Israeli official says his country would honor the cease - fire even if sporadic rock - throwing continues .

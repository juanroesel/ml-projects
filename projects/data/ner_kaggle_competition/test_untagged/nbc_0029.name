NBC 's David Gregory is at his post as well in Austin , Texas .
David any reaction from the Bush team on the Democrats ' plan to contest the vote in Miami - Dade ?
Well , John , there has been reaction from the Bush team .
You know , this decision by the Gore campaign , a refusal to concede even if they do not prevail in the manual recounts under way certainly carries some political risk , but the Gore team tonight defends the decision , saying that fellow Democrats and the public would not only accept but demand what they call a fair and accurate recount in all the relevant counties .
The Bush team , responding quickly saying there would not be such support and that in that scenario Gore could only be seen as a sore loser .
Despite the holiday , there is no letup in the fight for Florida .
A holiday legal victory to be thankful for , George and Laura Bush , all smiles in Austin today before a pot luck Thanksgiving meal with their twin daughters and friends .
The Texas governor makes time for recreation with a morning jog and prepares for some fishing at his ranch this weekend .
The Vice President out of sight today at his residence , aides saying the entire family together for a meal and football on TV .
While the Gore menu remains a family secret , the Bush clan all to happy to share some of his favorite fare -- jalapeno pecan cornbread stuffing and coconut cake .
For vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney , turkey in the hospital with his wife and daughter this afternoon .
After suffering a mild heart attack yesterday , his fourth , doctors say today he 's recovering well .
Cheney gets a checkup call from Governor Bush and still expects to be released as early as tomorrow , and today , President Clinton cautiously speaks out about the Florida vote fight , saying everyone should , `` let the process play out . ''
I want everybody who tried to vote who legally voted to have their vote count , including service people .
Everybody .
Tonight for both George Bush and Al Gore and their war rooms all their advisers , this really comes down to a numbers game .

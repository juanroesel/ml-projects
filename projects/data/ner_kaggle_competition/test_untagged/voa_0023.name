A new and simple blood test may soon be available to help doctors tell which of their diabetic patients is most likely to develop crippling and life - threatening complications .
VOA 's Jessica Berman explains .
Researcher Andrew Levi says scientists have long been puzzled by the question of which diabetics develop complications and why .
We know that the complications are directly related to a couple of things .
One is how long you 've had the diabetes , how well you 've been controlled , but it 's clear that people with the same level of control of their glucose , same duration of the diabetes differ dramatically in their susceptibility to these complications that are so devastating .
Dr. Levi says one third of insulin taking patients ends up with kidney failure and 80 % develop blinding eye disease .
Scientists have suspected there must be something different about the genetic make - up of diabetics who develop complications ; and that difference may have to do with haptoglobin , a protein whose function is to mop up blood vessel destroying free radicals .
The free radicals are released when oxygen carrying red blood cells called haemoglobin die .
Andrew Levi says there are three different types of haptoglobin and he and his colleagues at Israel 's Technion Institute have found that one type of haptoglobin called Type 1 - 1 appears protective against diabetic complications while the other two types do not .
Researchers at Technion Institute led by Dr. Levi have developed a simple blood test to let doctors and patients know who is most likely to develop diabetic complications .

Xinhua News Agency , Fuzhou , March 4th , by reporter Ting Xu
Fujian Province , located in southeast China 's coastal area , has tasted the benefits in recent years of the vigorous development of new high level technology industry .
Some experts believe that this foretells the transformation of industrial structure of this province from a low level , extensive type to a new high level technology dominance .
According to the Fujian " revival through science and education " strategy and the program of constructing high - tech industry belts on the western side of the Straits , by 2000 , the structural pattern of industry being led by new high level technology will basically be formed in this area .
The overall level of industrialization of new high level technology will stride into nationally advanced ranks .
Its new high level technology industry will achieve output of 60 billion yuan , accounting for 16 % of the total local industry output , with exports accounting for more than 10 % of that of the whole province .
Last year , Fujian province 's output of new high level technology industry reached 30 billion yuan , and its sales revenue was 49.6 billion yuan .
Experts expressed that developing new high level technology industry in Fujian will not only accelerate updating , upgrading and internationalization of local industry , but also make it possible for the area to finally become the best place for cooperation in science and technology , and economy and trade on both sides of the straits .
Beside the wide road of the national - level Fuzhou high level science and technology zone , the Zhonghua Imaging Company from Taiwan has undertaken constructing a factory building occupying tens of mu of land , and is preparing to produce monochrome image tubes through high level scientific and technological measures .
It is said that the project , whose investment is 3 billion yuan , has now entered a restructuring stage , and after full completion , its annual output could reach 7 billion yuan .
According to presentations of local officials , apart from the Fuzhou high level science and technology zone , currently , Fujian province possesses another national - level zone in the southern Xiamen SEC .
Additionally , five provincial - level high - tech industry development zones have been established in such places as Quanzhou , Putian , Zhangzhou , etc .
Last year , formally recognized as qualified new high level technology enterprises in these high science and technology zones reached 150 .
The above - mentioned development zones are basically located in the southeastern area of Fujian whose economy is the most active .
Enterprises within the zones focus their attention mainly on fields with certain scientific research strength , such as photoelectrons , computers , new material , bioengineering , etc .
In the past few years , scientific and technological achievements that have come out of researching , manufacturing and developing have mainly been new crystalline material , digital color TV with picture - in - picture function , UPS series products , bank POS systems , nationwide computer - controlled cement composite bag bagging machines , medium voltage switches , etc .
These products have already been identified by experts as high - tech products at either the international or national advanced levels .
Certain new high level technology enterprises , such as Fujian Hitachi Company , Ltd. , Xiahua Electronics Company , Ltd. , Fujian Shida Public Computer Company , Ltd. and Fujian Computer Peripheral Devices Factory , have already ascended to the ranks of the top 100 high level science and technology enterprises of China .
Fujian Province is one of the four regions in which the Chinese government decided to accelerate development in the '90s and make efforts in basically realizing modernization in 20 years .
At the same time , it is a key region where China strives to strengthen development stamina by developing new high level technology .
In the past seventeen years , Fujian Province , through developing its export - oriented economy , has made itself another economically prosperous region between the Zhujiang Delta and the Yangtze Delta .
People in economic circles here believe that , as the famous hometown of overseas Chinese which has maintained good long - term economic and trade relations and market connections with the regions of Hong Kong , Macao and Taiwan , and draws from such advantageous conditions as financing , information transmission , industry conversion , etc. , Fujian will have great prospects of developing new high level technology industry .

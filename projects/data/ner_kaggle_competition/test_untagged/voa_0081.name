Hello again and welcome , I am David Chadwick .
Israeli helicopter gunships were pressed into service Wednesday , as gun battles with Palestinians erupted on the West Bank near Bethlehem and at the border crossing into Gaza .
At least five Palestinian demonstrators and three Israeli soldiers were killed .
Both sides reported many injured .
Against that bloody backdrop , there were diplomatic efforts to call a ceasefire , but after a Washington meeting with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami said what 's happening is not a civilian uprising as the Palestinians claim , but a military confrontation , a mini war , as he put it .
Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat is expected to meet separately with Mrs. Albright and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , later this week .
Meanwhile , in the Middle East , former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat with whom he once shared the Nobel Peace Prize .
VOA 's Laurie Cassman reports there apparently was no breakthrough .
The Peres - Arafat meeting lasted for about two hours , but neither man had any comments on the contents of the discussions .
Earlier in the evening Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he was sending Mr. Peres with a message to the Palestinian leader to end the violence now .
For his part , Palestinian officials say Mr. Arafat wanted to call on Mr. Peres to get the Israelis to stop the fighting .
The meeting took place after an afternoon and evening of fierce clashes between the Israeli military and Palestinians in several West Bank towns and Gaza .
Three Israeli soldiers and at least half a dozen Palestinians including one policeman were killed in separate clashes .
After an emergency meeting with his security advisors Wednesday night , Prime Minister Barak warned of a tough response if the violence continues .
The Army will act firmly , he says , but without being drawn into adventurism .
Palestinian media says it has been warned to evacuate its broadcasting facility .
Radio says military commanders have provided Mr. Barak with a list of targets , but his word of caution against what he calls adventurism indicates heightened Israeli sensitivity to international accusations of an exaggerated use of force against the Palestinians .
Chief Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat says he was prevented by Israeli security from leaving his home in Jericho because of the fighting there .
Israeli combat helicopters are reported to have hit a hotel and casino in Jericho and a building of the Palestinian Authority .
Mr. Erekat is due to travel to Washington to meet with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other US officials attempting to win a ceasefire .
Mrs. Albright has already met with Israel 's acting Foreign Minister .

Amnesty International says Israel 's military tactics exhibit a pattern of gross human rights violations that could constitute war crimes .
A London - based human rights organizations says Israel 's use of tanks and helicopters is far out of proportion to the threat posed by Palestinian stone throwers .
Amnesty also criticized Palestinians for attacking Israeli civilians and said the Palestinian Authority is not doing enough to keep children away .

Time for `` Lifeline '' -- and fresh evidence tonight the kind of medical care you receive depends to a large degree on where you live , but maybe not for the reasons you 'recg .
It 's not just poor versus rich areas or rural versus urban .
NBC 's Robert Hager tonight on `` geographic destiny . ''
When Florence Kramer discovered she had breast cancer , a doctor in Farmington , Missouri , told her she needed a mastectomy -- breast removal .
I panicked and was frightened , and real depressed and upset .
But 70 miles away in St. Louis , doctors told her a less invasive lumpectomy , should be enough .
Man , I was overjoyed .
Her lumpectomy , was a success , and her case an example of the startling differences in doctors ' choices of treatment , from one geographic area to the next .
It 's all documented in an ongoing statistical analysis called `` the Dartmouth College Atlas of Health Care , '' directed by Dr John Wennberg .
What we 're seeing is that in health care geography is basically destiny , meaning you may be destined , if you live in one community , to have major surgery for the same problem normally treated , somewhere else , with a less invasive procedure or without surgery at all .
For instance , the Atlas finds , a breast cancer patient in Rapid City , South Dakota is twice as likely to have a mastectomy , as a patient with the same problem in the western suburbs of Cleveland .
Prostate cancer , in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , surgery , nine times more likely than in Binghamton , New York .
Heart disease , in Bloomington , Indiana , bypass operation , three times more likely , than in Albuquerque , New Mexico .
A back problem , in Santa Barbara , California , surgery six times more likely , than in Bronx , New York .
Why these great variations ?
Not what you may think .
Not the size of the community , the wealth of the patients , or quality of the hospital .
It seems to be more what doctors in each area are used to recommending , but patients do n't know that .
The problem of this incredible variation is to get the patients involved in making decisions that express their own preferences .
So Dartmouth 's Hitchcock Hospital has what 's called a `` shared decision making center , '' where patients are carefully presented all the options even shown videos , and in Pennsylvania , a patient advocate has this advice -- when the physician says , `` I believe you ought to have this procedure , '' the very next question you ask is `` well , why are you recommending that ? '' and the second question is `` what alternatives would you recommend , and what are my choices ? ''
Just why Florence Kramer traveled 70 miles for a second opinion .
If I 'm going to have something done to my body I want to know about it .
I want to know everything there is to know about it .
How she overcame geographic destiny avoided a mastectomy and remains cancer free , today .

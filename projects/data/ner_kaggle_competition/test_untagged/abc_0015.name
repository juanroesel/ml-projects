And now making hockey history --
the record for most victories by a goaltender in the National Hockey League has been held by Terry Sawchuck of the Detroit Red Wings since 1961 , and now comes Patrick Roy of the Colorado Avalanche .
Here 's ABC 's Brian Rooney .
In 16 years with the National Hockey League , Patrick Roy has stopped the other team from scoring 21,000 times , frequently doing the impossible .
Do you believe that ?
Highway robbery .
And the amazing thing is , he almost never sees the puck .
No , I do n't see the puck most of the time , especially when it 's really fast or at close range .
It 's more anticipating it .
He follows the action with his eyes , and just knows where the puck will go .
He plays what is known as butterfly style , splitting his legs , often playing from his knees , filling the net with his 6 ' 1 '' body .
90 % of the time , when you 're coming down on Patrick , all you see is his big jersey and the equipment , and you just do n't see net , so there 's room to shoot .
Roy has his quirks .
He talks to the goalposts and refuses to step on the red and blue lines .
He writes the names of his three children on his stick before every game , but he says the most important thing is not superstition , not even talent .
I think the passion .
If you love what you 're doing , and if you 're a passionate person , I mean , that will make the difference in the end .
When he breaks the record for most wins , Patrick Roy will replace Detroit 's late Terry Sawchuk in the record books .
From George Vezina in the to Gump Worsely , who had a face stitched like a quilt , and Roy 's hero , Rogie Vachon , pioneer of an aggressive style , the goalie has been the loner of the end of the rink .
They used to play without a mask , but now the game is faster and the puck flies at 100 miles an hour .
Years ago , the goaltenders were kind of the guys that could n't play defense , could n't play forward , maybe were n't good skaters , so they put them in net .
Today , I think they 're as good an athlete as any other player on the team .
And Patrick Roy has established a standard that the goalie has to be an athlete on a par with the best of any sport .
He has won the Stanley Cup three times .
I just wanted to survive , you know .
I just wanted to break that league and survive in it as long as I could , and being in that position today is something big for me .
He loves to play , which is just another thing that might make him the greatest goalie the game has ever had .

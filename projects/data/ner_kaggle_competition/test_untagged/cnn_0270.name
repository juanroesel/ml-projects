We turn now to an Iraqi --
First of all , before we tell you about this story , we were going to , these are live pictures from Baghdad .
There 's been some activity in the last few moments .
Looks like tracer fire we 're looking at , anti-aircraft guns firing at what they sense is some sort of threat coming from the skies .
Baghdad has had sporadic episodes of this tonight .
No major explosions we 're aware of , but just , apparently , in the last few moments , there has been activity .
You can see it there just now .
We 've been reporting , the city has begun to see its electricity turned back on .
We do n't know that all of it is back , but at least some of it is .
We also know that 12 miles southwest of the city , coalition forces remain largely in control of what was formerly Saddam Hussein International Airport , now renamed by the coalition Baghdad International Airport , but the coalition is quick to point out that they do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the airport .
Again , this is -- these are live pictures of Baghdad , where it is well into the night .
We 're , of course , going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn .

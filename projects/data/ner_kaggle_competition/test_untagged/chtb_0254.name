Lockheed and Martin - Marietta , two old - brand military industrial corporations of the US , announced merging on the 30th , forming the US 's largest defense equipment contractor corporation .
Lockheed Company and Martin Company are additional participants in the growing trend of takeovers and mergers of US companies in the last few months .
This trend has spread widely to pharmaceutical and medical instrument companies , telecommunication and high - tech companies as well as retail , banks and railway companies , etc .
According to the statistics of " Time " magazine , from January to July this year , the asset value of takeovers announced by US companies was as high as 171.6 billion US dollars increasing by about half over the same period last year .
Within that , in the first 7 months of this year , takeovers and mergers in total announced by four big US industries , medical treatment , media , telecommunications and banking , reached 1062 , accounting for one fourth of all takeovers .
Regardless of whether it is the number of takeover companies or the value of takeover assets , both exceeded or were close to the peak of US company takeovers in the late '80's .
Observers here hold that since 1994 , reasons for the US company takeover trend differ from those of the past .
Firstly , the general trend of globalization of the world economy compels companies to expand scale and combine businesses , increase their overall competitive strength and to reduce costs .
Secondly , the Clinton government 's thoughts and actions in constructing the information highway , adjusting the financial industry and reforming the medical insurance system compels related companies to make strategic adjustments .
Moreover , the White House 's attitude towards anti-trust laws is somewhat more relaxed than before .
Taking the pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies as an example , reforms of hospitals expanding scales of purchasing medicine and medical treatment equipment , and thus reducing unit costs and expanding services , have spread throughout the country .
That the Columbia Medical Company purchased two hospital groups within one month last year , thus integrating pharmaceuticals , medical treatment and sales , is one such example .
For telecommunications companies , the merger of telephone companies with cable TV and wireless communications companies frequently is to mutually complement one another in operations and to dominate the market .
Recently , the US Congress passed an inter-state banking law , allowing regional banks to operate in other states .
Handholding among banks is also to reduce overlapping services so as to reduce costs , to strengthen base assets , and expand credit scales .
For military industry enterprises , the merger of Lockheed and Martin and the combination of two old - brand corporations , namely Northrop and Grumman , are both due to the same reason : after the cold war , the America 's national defense expenditures gradually reduced , and the scale and strength of military industry enterprises is one of the conditions necessary for winning limited government weapons purchasing contracts .
Observers here believe that company takeovers has a positive aspect , i.e. , the reduction of cost , the increase in efficiency , and the strengthening of competitive power .
But , many takeovers are obviously actions that must be taken for companies to survive .
However , history has proven that " big and complete " monopolies of production and sales is not beneficial to the national economy 's healthy development .
For instance , in the '70's , mergers of US steel mills directly led to the birth of a few large - scale unified steel companies , but these companies also faced serious threats from small - scale steel mills , which are flexible in operation and advanced in technology .
Moreover , company takeovers have had bad effects on consumers in terms of product quality and price , and at the same time on workers ' employment .
While voice has been given to the opinion that small enterprises are the new forces of economic growth , scaled operation of big corporations will constantly face new difficulties .

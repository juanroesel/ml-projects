There was a rowdy session of parliament that Ehud Barak addressed today .
It was the first time Israeli lawmakers had assembled since the Palestinian uprising began a month ago .
Prime Minister Barak told the legislature that he believes peace in the Middle East is still possible , but that Israel does not have a partner prepared to make compromises .
A spirit of compromise was also hard to find in the parliament , as The World 's Katy Clark reports .
Ehud Barak 's optimism that peace can still be achieved comes as the Israeli Prime Minister struggles to keep his left center party in office .
Barak has been working without a parliamentary majority since July when right wing and religious parties deserted his coalition government in protest over the way he was handling peace negotiations .
Today , Israel 's third largest party , the ultra-orthodox Shaff agreed to support Barak for the time being , but while that seems to have won the beleaguered Prime Minister a reprieve , it did n't stop other right wing legislators from shouting down Barak 's address to parliament today , and the Israeli Prime Minister also had to contend with furious Arab - Israeli legislators .
Today , I have no confidence in Mr. Barak .

We presented already a non-confidence motion , my party the Arab Movement for Change and it will be discussed during the next week .
Barak had hoped to open today 's session by announcing the formation of a national emergency unity government with Ariel Sharon 's opposition Likud Party , but negotiations this past weekend to form such a coalition were inconclusive .
That 's just as well according to Shible Tel Hamie of the Brooklyn Institution .
Tel Hamie acknowledges that if Barak had succeeded in getting Sharon to join up in a new government , the Prime Minister would have a majority in parliament , but he would also be in a bind internationally because with sharon , who did not have a nice image internationally , who went alone in the Middle East , and clearly , the Palestinians would be less likely to cooperate with that government , so he faces a major tension between his peace agenda and his domestic agenda .
As if Barak needed any reminding of that , the chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Eraket today criticized Barak for tailoring his speech to the Israeli right wing .
Arakat predicted that Barak 's latest political maneuvering would have a negative effect on the peace process .

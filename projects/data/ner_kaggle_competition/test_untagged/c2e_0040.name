Title : The Story of Teeth -LRB- 6 -RRB- .

I have kept the good habit of having my teeth cleaned ever since I knew it could claim my life if I abruptly go to clean my teeth after years of leaving them uncleaned .
After my still upright but " left - tilting " teeth crouched in my mouth safely and soundly for another two years , another revolution erupted half a year after I graduated and found a job .
The revolution could be said a rudimentary one , which made me decide eventually to eliminate all the betrayers and heretics in one action !.
The incident was caused by a molar .
The location of the tooth was just next to the broken wisdom tooth that led to my first visit to an American dentist .
For some unknown reason , when I was eating the other day , the tooth suddenly ached during the meal , and it was very painful .
Unexpected I heard a " crack " while I was eating , and part of the tooth fell off !.
I could not remember eating anything hard ?!.
I rushed to the dentist , who said root canal therapy upon seeing it , your dental nerve had come out !.
I did not know what root canal meant but thought the name was quite fancy .
It was after I began to receive it that I found it really painful !.
For example killing the nerves , and dealing with the dental crown ...
I asked the dentist then why my tooth broke .
After examining my 25 teeth , the dentist told me seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat " cross biting " due to the " parallel shift " of my teeth , such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other .
The wrong position had led to uneven abrasions , resulting in the broken tooth .
I asked what solutions are available ?
The dentist said " correction . "
Thus , three years after I ran away from the " brigand orthodontist , " I stepped into the orthodontist 's office again ...

Hard work without talent is a shame , but talent without hardwork is a tragedy !
-LRB- are you a shame or a tragedy ?? or maybe a " Shamgerdy ? " -RRB- .

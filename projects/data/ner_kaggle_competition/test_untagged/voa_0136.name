Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is proposing to transfer to the Palestinians another 10 % of the West Bank and to recognize a Palestinian state under a possible future extended interim accord .
Palestinian officials are rejecting the offer saying it does not meet their main concerns over Jerusalem and refugees .
Correspondent Eve Connan in Jerusalem reports the violence in the Middle East continues as Mr. Barak and other politicians begin preparing for early elections .
Prime Minister Barak , offering an unusually detailed description of his peace plan , said Thursday he would recognize an independent Palestinian state , but would postpone negotiating the issue of control over Jerusalem .
Mr. Barak is hoping to hammer out a peace deal with the Palestinians before facing early elections two years into what should have been his four - year term .
He suggested that if no accord was reached on Jerusalem , Palestinians should be granted 10 % of the West Bank under an interim agreement , but the Palestinians are seeking a permanent peace deal that would grant them independence and East Jerusalem as their capital .
Mr. Barak told a news conference he is not trying to speed up peace negotiations in order to win re-election , but that he will not delay efforts to end the violence .

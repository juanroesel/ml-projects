The Voice of America presents differing points of views on a wide variety of issues .
Next , an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government .
A Federal Grand Jury in New York has indicted five more suspects in connection with the August 1998 bombing of the United States embassies in Nairobi Kenya and Dar - e - salaam Tanzania .
These terrorist attacks killed hundreds and wounded thousands of men , women and children .
The indictments raised to 22 the number of those accused in the bombings .
Of the seventeen terrorists previously charged , eight have been captured .
The remaining fugitives , including Osama Bin Laden , are still being sought by the US .
The latest to be indicted are Saif Al Adel , Mushan Musa Matwali Atwa , Ahmed Mohammed Hamid Ali , Ahnes Alibi and Abdullah Ahmed Ardullah .
All are members of Al - Qaida , an Islamic terrorist group organized by Osama Bin Laden .
Al - Qaida has helped train terrorists from Tajikstan , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Chechnya , Somalia , Sudan , Yemen , the Philippines , Egypt , Libya , Pakistan and Eritrea .
Al - Qaida receives safe haven from Taliban controlled Afghanistan where it operates a network of training facilities and conducts international terrorist operations .
The United Nations Security Council voted to expand sanctions on the Taliban movement because of its support for Al - Qaida and other terrorists .
The US supports these sanctions .
The US calls on the Taliban movement to end its sponsorship of international terrorism and hand over the terrorist fugitives it now protects .
The US is offering a reward of up to 5 million dollars for information that leads to the apprehension or conviction of Al - Qaida terrorists Sheikh Amed Salim Suedan , Ahmed Galani , Mustafa Mohammed Fadel , Imn Auzava Heari , Mohammed Altaf and Osama Bin Laden for their part in the African embassy bombings .
The US will not rest until these men have been brought to justice for their crimes .
That was an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government .

Another Business Trip to San Jose
Michael Zhou
Next week , I will go to San Jose for a three - day business trip .
I have no choice but to go .
My wife will have a hard time again at home .
We plan to make dumplings and steamed buns on weekend to be used as food reserve for next week .
On this trip to California , I plan to pay a visit to my Cisco colleagues and friends .
They all moved to California from RTP for different reasons .
It 's so hard to make a hotel reservation .
I do n't know whether it is because of an upcoming big conference , all hotels in the 10 - mile radius from San Jose have been booked up .
I could only find a Sheraton in Pleasant about 25 miles from the company .
I must make sure to bring my own GPS before I set out in case there is no GPS in the rental car .

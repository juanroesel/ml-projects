" 8 / 15 " - our victory day .
（一）
For the Chinese people , today is a special day .
This day came with great difficulty for China .
Before the war , the gap between China and Japan was far greater than mere numbers .
Before the war , China 's steel production was less than 200,000 tons -LRB- steel production in China was centered mainly in the northeast , and it was controlled by the Japanese -RRB- .
Japan 's was about 9 million tons .
The important thing is that Japan had a complete industrial system and was able to independently produce all its weapons , from handguns to aircraft carriers , and it had a formidable research production capacity .
At that time , every year they were able to produce 1,580 airplanes , 744 large - bore cannon , 330 tanks , , more than 9,500 vehicles , with a shipbuilding capacity of more than 400,000 tons and a naval construction capacity of 50,000 tons .
Compared to this , at the time China could only produce rifles and small cannon ; its capacity to produce heavy weapons was zero .
The only munitions plant capable of producing heavy weapons in the northeast was taken over by the Japanese .
This means that China 's consumption could not be met .
Before the war , China 's air force had some 300 airplanes ; that may seem like quite a few , but they were all used up in just one year , and afterward we could only watch as Japanese aircrafts ruled the skies over China .
On the surface , China is a large country , and Japan was the little guy taking on the giant .
The most obvious part of China 's being a big country was its population advantage .
In fact Japan 's total population after it had taken over Taiwan , the Northeast , and Korea was not so very much smaller than China 's , with about 200 million people , at best a 2:1 ratio .
The important thing is that Japan had a complete reserve system , with more than four million reserves who had received basic military training .
China had basically no reserve military personnel , and the " national army " relied primarily on seizing able - bodied men to fill its ranks .
These so - called able - bodied men were sorely lacking in training ; all they could do was learn to fight in battle .
Therefore , in the field , it often happened that a Japanese battalion -LRB- battalion system -RRB- was able to defeat a whole division of the Chinese army ; it was not just the difference in equipment : even more important were the differences in logistical supplies and training .
-RAB- The training gap in particular can be said to have been the difference between earth and sky .
In terms of the standards of Western armies , except for a few divisions , at the time for most of the millions of Chinese military units of every description it would be more appropriate to speak of militia , or mobs of bandits .
What was even more disheartening was China 's disintegration :
After ten years of bloody battles between the Nationalists and the Communists , and among the warlords like Jiang , Feng , Yan and Gui , China 's vital organs were diseased , and it was like adding frost on top of snow .
Japan 's plans to " conquer China in one attack " and to " take China in three to six months " were not mere fantasy .
China 's low - key War of Resistance also had a basis in reality : it seemed that without a miracle , China would be doomed .
-LRB 2 -RRB-
But the miracle happened , and what is more , this miracle was created by the Chinese people !
In the face of an unprecedented national enemy , the Chinese race demonstrated rare courage and fortitude .
In terms of their military strength , China 's army taking on the Japanese army was like an egg attacking a rock .
But the eggs advanced again and again , and the wounds on the rock added up !
In Shanghai , in Taierzhuang , in Wanjialing , the prestige of the " Great Japanese Imperial Army " came tumbling down again and again .
In his memoirs , Li Zongren took great delight in talking about Taierzhuang , where he used cast - off troops , Sichuan troops and Northeastern troops to inflict heavy losses on the supremely arrogant " Great Japanese Imperial Army " ; in his own view , it was all rather inconceivable .
For four years , from 1937 to 1941 , China fought against Japan on its own , and it even counterattacked .
China organized a winter offensive on the front in 1939 .
In 1940 there were a hundred battles in the enemy 's rear area , which let the Japanese army know that their enemy was still alive and kicking .
In order to resolve the " China incident , " Japan sent in even young boys to fight ; at the height of it , there was only one division left in Japan .
Of course if Japan had fully mobilized , it could have called up several million more troops , as in the later time when they knew they were about to be annihilated .
But mobilizing troops at home and sending them off to another country are two different things ; it was just that their logistics could n't support it .
Troops leaving the country to fight need to be lean and vigorous .
It was n't that the Japanese did n't want to settle the " China incident , " it was that they could n't .
What created this miracle in reality was the awakening of the sense of modern Chinese nationhood .
In historical China , you were loyal to the emperor , not to the country .
Yue Fei directly smashed the home of the enemy in order to wash away the " shame of Jingkang and the officials ' regret . "
When Shi Kefa wept blood , it was for the death of the Chongzhen Emperor .
In the War of Anti-Japanese Resistance , the Chinese people burned with an enormous patriotic fervor , and they demonstrated a fierce determination to resist .
In their memoirs , generals of the Nationalist army mention that when they were wounded in the civil war no one paid any attention , and they themselves all felt like thieves .
But generals wounded fighting the Japanese received endless fresh flowers in condolence , making them feel like the center of attention .
This was such an enormous contrast that it was a great stimulus for the Nationalist army generals .
With the fatherland in jeopardy , even overseas Chinese demonstrated unprecedented patriotic fervor , vigorously supporting China 's War of Resistance , providing both manpower and financial aid .
Large numbers of overseas Chinese returned to fight ; in some years the aid donated by overseas Chinese amounted to one - half of the government 's expenditures , creating a fresh contrast to the historically poor image of the Chinese as lacking civic pride and being politically indifferent .
During the War of Resistance , overseas Chinese donated hundreds of times more money than did overseas Japanese .
The Central Army , the Jin Army , the Sichuan Army , the Northwest Army , the Gui Army , etc. , and of course the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army , which until then had been implacable enemies , came together to rescue the imperiled nation , and that was not an easy matter .
At the time , the officers and men of the Red Army almost all had an account of blood and tears .
The Nationalist Army 's purging of the Red Army base areas was no less fierce than the Japanese policy of killing , burning and looting .
If we think of the end of the Ming Dynasty , when the state was about to fall , the southern Ming continued its bickering , with endless internal disputes among the various princes who all seemed to be enjoying it .
-LRB- In Jin Yong 's masterpiece , Luding Annals , just for the sake of selecting an heir between Zhu Three and Zhu Five , two royal families started fighting and got one of the key persons killed , which stirred up a great storm . -RRB-
The state of disunity repeatedly lamented by Sun Yatsen had quite unexpectedly turned to unity , and at least in the early phases of the War of Resistance all sides basically cooperated in good faith and all made an effort ; it ca n't be said that this is not a miracle of history .
For example , Brothers Magic Sky -LRB- Chen Qingpin , Chen Zhonghou -RRB- previously read a book ; the author signed his name as " Shaohua , Youhu . "
The book was entitled " Lin Biao : His Life "
In the ninth chapter , " First Medal in the War against Japan , " it mentions that after the great victory at Pingxingguan , Lin Biao was accidentally wounded .
At the time , the chief of staff and front - line commander of the Kuomintang 's second theater of operations , Wei Lihuang , got the news and made a special trip to Ershilibao in Yan'an to extend his condolences .
The next day , he was unexpectedly detained as he returned to Xi'an , and he personally ordered that the Eighth Route Army be given a million rounds of ammunition , 250,000 hand grenades , and 180 boxes of cartons of beef .
" Thirty days later , when more than ten military trucks brought the ammunition and canned beef to Ershilibao , a flush of red appeared on Lin Biao 's pallid face , and he said repeatedly , " It 's a huge gift , it 's a huge gift ! "
This shows that the War of Resistance was the cradle for the rebirth of the Chinese people .
During the war , the Japanese left no stone unturned in threatening to bribe Chinese into collaborating .
But of the many powerful local warlords , not one went over to the other side .
Even outmoded warlords like Yan Xishan in Shanxi , or Long Yun in Yunnan , or Wu Peifu could not be won over .
Compared to the end of the Ming Dynasty , it can not be said that this too is not a miracle .

Around Sept. 18 , 1931 , China , despite entreaties at the League of Nations , never got any sympathy or support , but after July 7 , 1937 , China relied on its own resistance to win international respect and assistance ; Heaven helps those who help themselves .
A strong sense of nationhood supported the Chinese people through repeated losses and battles , and helped it get through those dark days .
China 's perseverance was just the right thing to strike at Japan 's weak spot ; countries like Japan have trouble sustaining a high - intensity war .
The First Sino - Japanese War , the Russo - Japanese War and 9/18 all ended in a short time , and there were no destructive effects on Japan 's economic structure .
On the other hand , each time they fought , they acquired a large amount of booty , which greatly increased Japan 's strength .
But the War of Resistance was not like that ; the Japanese were unable to support the war through fighting .
Despite America 's strength and wealth , it was even unable to bear the cost of the Vietnam War .
Four years of fierce fighting in China had in fact left Japan exhausted ; military spending was exploding , inflation at home was soaring , supplies were stretched thin , gold and foreign currency reserves were depleted , and the domestic economy was on the verge of collapse , and this enabled America to throttle the Japanese by the neck , meaning that they forced the Japanese to take a highly risky military gamble .
The outbreak of the war in the Pacific was a turning point .
Since Japan is an island , sea transport is its lifeline , so the decisive field of battle was the Pacific .
The Chinese field of battle had already fulfilled its mission .
China did not have the strength to chase out the Japanese army .
And the Japanese did not have the capability to wipe out the " Chongqing army " and the " Yan'an army . "
Both sides could only stay put and wait .
" If allied forces win , China can not lose ;
If the allied forces lose , China can not win . "
Although it upset the Americans , the Kuomintang blamed the Communist Party for not attacking ; the Communist Party accused the Kuomintang of remaining passive , but that was necessary at the time .
Although we were unable to drive the Japanese out , because this exceeded China 's industrial capacity and technical and economic levels at the time , " 8/15 " is still our Victory Day .
Our sacrifice well deserves this victory , because we made every effort .
Among the five victorious nations of the Soviet Union , the United States , China , England and France , China is more qualified than England and France to bask in the glory of victory .
Before WWII , in the area of world industry and modern military affairs , China was really unworthy of mention , not even on a par with Poland , Yugoslavia or any other mid-level European country .
China 's contribution to the war against Fascism in fact far surpassed its own abilities .
And this contribution was made using " blood and flesh to build our new Great Wall . "
For this day , millions of Chinese soldiers stained the battlefield with their blood , and tens of millions of ordinary people died , billions of yuan in assets were lost : it was a huge price to pay .
We can not forget our glory , nor can we forget the price we paid .

Several years back Zhou Zuoren and Zhang Ailing 's works thrilled a generation .
But some people complained that they have been treated unfairly .
Their works certainly appeal to the emotions and tastes of people nowadays who have gotten rich by various means , and literarily speaking they could sometimes be original .
But literature is a moral force , and the integrity of these easy - living social paragons is even lower than that of thieves ; they certainly have no sense of duty to their country , and it can even be said that they have no shame .
How can they expect to be respected by society as a whole ?
What kind of soul do their works have ?
If we can forgive Zhou Zuoren and Zhang Ailing , then how , at the very worst , can we face Zhao Yiman , Yang Jingyu and Chao Shangzhi , who at the same historical period crawled over ice and slept in snow , willing to die rather than yield ?
Our world is still not peaceful ; our enemies are still eyeing us covetously .
Wang Jingwei , Zhou Zuoren , Zhang Ailing and their ilk should be relegated to history 's wall of shame forever .

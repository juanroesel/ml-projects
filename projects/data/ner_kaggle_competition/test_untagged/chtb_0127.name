Tianjin is the largest coastal city of northern China .
It is ranked at the top in making use of foreign capital among all large cities in northern China .
At present , there are more than 11,000 foreign funded enterprises , of which over 3,000 have started operations .
With the increase in the number of foreign funded enterprises , various kinds of financial disputes also emerge continuously .

Last year , dispute cases involving foreign investment enterprises accepted by Tianjin went down by nearly 40 % compared with that of the previous year .
The rate of resolving cases in the same year reached 97 % , up by 3 % over the previous year , and dispute litigants ' degree of satisfaction with agreement results reached 96 % .
This year , Tianjin will continue to establish and complete relevant local regulations and rules for foreign investment enterprises , so that the production and operation of foreign investment enterprises have laws to rely on .
Up to now , Tianjin and the government have already drafted over thirty local regulations and rules concerning foreign investment , to guide foreign companies in investment , to strengthen management and service to foreign invested enterprises , and to protect legitimate rights and interests of domestic and foreign investors and employees .
The foreign investment management departments and justice organizations insist on administrating according to law and handling cases according to law , so that they have effectively protected rights and interests of each party .
Shuzu Wang said that the management of foreign investment enterprises will also be implemented even more through laws and regulations .
Within the past year , all levels of foreign investment enterprise management departments were administered according to law , listened to foreign merchants opinions numerous times , and implemented a clean up of the phenomenon of illegal charges by some administrative departments .
At the same time , they strengthened the supervision and management work of the execution of contracts by foreign investment enterprises , supervised and urged enterprises to conscientiously perform rights and responsibilities stipulated by contracts , implemented criticism and education for enterprises which breached contracts and gave time limits to amend , and investigated and dealt with those which operate illegally .
Last year , Tianjin carried out a united annual inspection of nearly 8,000 of three - capital enterprises .

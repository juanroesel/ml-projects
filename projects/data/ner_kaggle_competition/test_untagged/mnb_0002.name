That same storm system derailed a fundraisings trip from Bill Clinton , and for a brief time it made it impossible for the head of the free world to watch his Vice President debate on public television .
It was in all not a good day for Bill Clinton yesterday .
Air Force One was stranded grounded by the heavy rains .
At the hotel , the storm knocked out the cable TV .
The President tried the TV in the bar .
No luck .
The President 's aides arranged for him to watch it in a big screen TV in the denial of a big campaign donor .
He missed 45 minutes .
Tonight his bullet and bomb proof limousine broke down .
Repair attempts were unsuccessful .
He was switched to a backup car .
The day got worse when he urged all Americans to vote on November 2 .
The election is on November 7 .

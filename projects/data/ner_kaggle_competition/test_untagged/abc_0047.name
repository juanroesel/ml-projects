And finally tonight , to Russia , with interest and curiosity .
While we may have our own problems here with a roller coaster of an election , they 've got some flip - flopping of their own going on when it comes to their national anthem .
ABC 's Richard Gizbert reports .
In a country that shed most symbols of its authoritarian past almost a decade ago , one of them is coming out of retirement -- the old Soviet anthem .
It was always a bold , stirring melody , a feature of the military parades in Red Square that Westerners came to recognize through medal ceremonies at the Olympic Games , but , like most Soviet symbols , it had to go .
`` we should bury it forever , '' this man says .
`` Our citizens were massacred to the sound of that anthem , and we were deprived of our freedom . ''
So Boris Yeltsin , who throughout his presidency displayed an interest in , if not a sophistication for , music , got rid of it .
He replaced it with a century Russian composition -- 7777 -- an instrumental with no lyrics to offend anyone , and that 's part of the problem .
Russian athletes were uncomfortably mute when their new lyric-less anthem was played .
Some even complained that it hurt team morale .
Ordinary Russians have difficulty humming the tune -- humming dissonantly -- not like the old anthem , 7777 humming melodically and Boris Yeltsin 's successor , President Vladimir Putin was clearly not a fan .
Putin , a Soviet - era KGB agent , wanted to revive the Soviet anthem .
He wants to present this idea of a strong state in symbols , in the flag , in the national anthem , but Putin realized that the anthem 's old pro-Communist lyrics would n't resonate in the new Russia .
So this past week parliament approved Putin 's compromise proposal , bring the melody of the old anthem back and come up with some new words .
Agreeing on those new words will not be easy , in a country that often can not escape or does not want to escape its Soviet past .

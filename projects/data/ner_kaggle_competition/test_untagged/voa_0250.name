Former President Clinton drew cheers from admirers at a US Air Force base outside Washington today before departing for his home in New York , and although Mr. Clinton is out of office , he says he 'll still be around .
So you see that sign there says , `` Please do n't go '' .
I left the White House , but I 'm still here .
Go anywhere .
Prior to leaving office today Mr. Clinton issued more than one hundred presidential pardons .
Among those pardoned was Susan Mcdoogle , a former business partner of Mr. Clinton who became a key figure in the White Water Real Estate investigation that plagued the Clinton presidency .

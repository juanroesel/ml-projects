Clare Dule reports .
North Korea 's political climate may be improving , but its economy is on the brink of collapse .
Many of its 22 million citizens face starvation if foreign aid contributions do n't rise significantly next year .
The World Food Program warns that a generation of children are going to grow up malnourished and they are the lucky ones .
Many may not survive at all .
This year 's harvest was poorer than at the height of the famine in 1997 .
Hit by drought at planting time and typhoons during harvesting , the country will have to rely on serial imports to feed its population .

It 's the " Knowledge - Based " Economy , Stupid !

A saying has it that " knowledge is power . "
But here at the turn of the century , people are discovering that knowledge is more than just power ; it is also profit .
Responding to the new realities , the Executive Yuan has put forward a plan to develop Taiwan 's " knowledge - based economy " which aims to double per capita income within ten years .
This plan embraces the long-term economic goals of the new administration .
But what is covered under the rubric of developing the knowledge - based economy ?
What conditions are required to be successful ?
Does Taiwan meet these criteria ?
Did you know that 90 % of the knowledge in the world has been produced in the half century since the end of World War II ?
And in 20 years , what we know today will be only one percent of the total knowledge bank of our children !
" It is estimated that the pool of human knowledge doubled once every fifty years in the 19th century , and about once every ten years in the 20th century .
Now it doubles once every three to five years , " notes Wu Se-hwa , dean of the business school at National Chengchi University .
The explosive growth of information is the most distinctive feature of the 20th century , and has brought sweeping changes to the world 's political , social , and economic structure .
Profit defines value
In 1992 , shortly after US president Bill Clinton took office , he declared that emphasis should be placed on research and development and on creating a " new economy . "
It turns out that these last eight years in the US have been a golden age of high economic growth , falling unemployment , and stable prices .
In 1996 , the OECD coined the term " knowledge - based economy , " and many governments have jumped on the bandwagon since .
You can call it the " new economy " or the " knowledge - based economy " or whatever , but what is it really ?
How can such an economy be created ?
Because each country has different development needs , there are many different answers to these questions .
Wu Se-hwa points out that the term " knowledge - based economy " refers to any economic activity based on the production or application of knowledge , in which " knowledge " includes all kinds of technology , patents , management know-how , and individual creations .
It is not important how profound or esoteric the knowledge may be ; what matters most is turning that knowledge into a product which can earn a profit .
Looking back at the economic history of the West , in 16th century society , agricultural products were the key to wealth and power .
Whoever had the most , and most fertile , land was in a dominant position .
In the industrial age , capitalists who commanded the wealth to buy machinery and hire workers , or who owned critical resources like coal and oil , replaced landowners as the dominant figures in the economy .
But today , whoever owns systematized knowledge will win out over his or her competitors .
When Lester Thurow , the well - known economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , came to Taiwan to give a lecture a half year ago , he pointed to the Microsoft Corporation as a prime example : Microsoft owns no farmland , no oil fields , no expensive and sophisticated factories , and no shops of its own .
Its product fits onto a tiny microchip .
Yet this company , relying only on the brainpower of several thousand engineers sitting in front of computers writing programs , has earned billions upon billions of dollars for owner Bill Gates .
It is estimated that 300 million persons use Microsoft Windows each day around the world , with annual revenues reaching US$ 25 billion .
Knowledge petrie dish
In the past , Chinese people discovered much knowledge and invented much technology , but , influenced by the Confucian belief that profit was not a worthy application of wisdom , never converted these into commercial products .
But in the face of today 's dramatic global economic transformation , there is no choice but to try to turn knowledge into profit .
And the thing that links knowledge with profit is information technology -LRB- IT -RRB- .
Hsu Wen-hsing , founder of Smartek Engineering , whose company has twice won national awards in Taiwan for its fingerprint verification device , says that human history can be seen as the history of information .
When Marco Polo visited the East in the 13th century , if he had not left a written account of his travels , it would have been a virtually wasted trip .
The recent enthusiasm for the Taipei exhibition of terracotta warriors from Xi'an is due to the fact that these long - buried figures contain information about mysteries dating back 2000 years .
Hsu Wen-hsing points out that in the past information was always tied to material objects , and remained in the hands of the few .
When the material objects disappeared , so did the information they contained .
But now , thanks to IT , for the first time in history information can be forever stored in huge volume , ready and waiting to be manipulated , exchanged , and even sent across great distances .
IT is like a petrie dish .
Information cells swim around in it , and can divide , recombine , reproduce , and copy themselves without limit , opening up entirely new possibilities for the accumulation and application of knowledge .
For example , computers are capable of finding numbers hidden under or scattered throughout a huge pile of data which is impenetrable to the human brain , and can analyze and clarify these numbers into useful know-how .
" One order form is not information .
But , by using a computer to save , connect , and search individual order forms , one can draw a thread through tens of thousands of them , and discern their regularities and variations .
Now that 's knowledge , " declares Simon Chang , president of Acer CyberCenter Services .
At a glance you can find information such as regional and seasonal variations in sales , or market acceptance of a given product .
And if there is a problem , it can be identified immediately , avoiding guesswork and wasted time .
Everyone a multibillionaire !
In the information world , everyone is equal .
Though huge multinational corporations may have an edge in terms of information technology , since the rapid growth of the Internet in the 1990s , ' little guys ' whom no one has ever heard of before - relying only on programming ability , creativity , and hard work - have had the space to bring their talents into play .
The best - known example is Yahoo , the world 's number one web portal .
It all started with two Stanford PhD students looking for a way to categorize the websites online , who came up with a great idea for a way to make finding information easier for Internet users .
With this idea , after six years of hard work , today Yahoo has a market value of US$ 50 billion .
Over the past five years profits have grown at a rate of 9800 % , which has got to be some kind of record .
However , though knowledge may be profitable , its value is subject to severe fluctuation .
George Tsao , assistant vice president of the Knowledge Management Center at Winbond Electronics Corporation , notes that in the past you could determine the worth of a company by adding up its fixed assets -LRB- such as land and factories -RRB- and liquid assets -LRB- such as cash -RRB- , with each calculable down to the last penny .
But knowledge is intangible .
Two different software packages burned onto identical chips can have grossly different values .
Sometimes it all depends on luck or fads .
The dramatic rise and fall of US software stocks this past year reflects the difficulty of assessing the value of knowledge .
Wu Se-hwa points to Intel as a prime example of how knowledge can " convert silicon to gold . "
A name - card sized CPU is in fact just a chipboard with complicated circuitry , with a unit cost of less than US$ 35 .
But because it includes unique information that makes the computer run , and carries the authority of " Intel inside , " it can fetch over US$ 1000 in the marketplace , many times the cost of production .
What about Taiwan ?
Clearly there is already a global trend in which an information economy is taking shape .
What advantages does Taiwan have for playing a larger role in this realm ?
Simon Chang , who left the job of director of planning at the National Science Council only six months ago to enter the private sector , points out that the knowledge - based economy basically deals in information technology , and the IT industry is the most profitable region in the emerging geography of the knowledge - based economy .
Taiwan currently ranks fourth in the world in value of IT production , and , if you include the plants established by Taiwan investors across the globe , Taiwanese - controlled firms lead the world in manufacturing of IT hardware .
In other words , Taiwan has a solid manufacturing base and a large pool of high quality human resources on which it can rely to develop the knowledge - based economy .
Also , Taiwan has a strong education system .
The results of a recent international survey measuring the performance of junior high school students in natural sciences and math show that Taiwan kids finished first in the former and third -LRB- behind only Singapore and Korea -RRB- in the latter .
Alice Chang , CEO of CyberLink Corporation , whose firm has become a much - coveted new entry in the stock market and has drawn international attention with audio-visual software like Power DVD and Talking Show , says : " Talented people are at the root of knowledge . "
AV software is very difficult to produce , and staff must have a solid grounding in math .
This is where Taiwan is at an advantage .
However , though Taiwan has its strong points , there are also a number of problems and shortcomings .
" The first thing to consider , says Wu Se-hwa , " is this :
What kind of knowledge - based economy is Taiwan most suited to ? "
Wu says that right now what the government is focusing on and what stock market players most hope for is a US - style " new economy . "
The focus is on new industries , such as software and the Internet , or communications technology , fiber - optics , biotechnology , and the like .
But can the American model be reproduced in Taiwan ?
There is little reason to be optimistic .
The new economy in the US depends heavily , for one thing , on a deep foundation of basic scientific research , which comes up with revolutionary products like genetically modified foods .
Another key factor is that the US has a mechanism for innovation and entrepreneurship , so that new ideas have a chance to be brought into play .
The rapid growth in the new economy has driven a decade - long economic boom in the States .
The old manufacturing economy has naturally been trimmed back , with factories relocating overseas , but American firms can depend on the rights to technology to earn a profit .
Pearl Tan , public relations manager at Applied Materials Taiwan , a subsidiary of the giant US semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name , points to a prime example : DRAM , the hottest industry in Taiwan , which was a monopoly of the US firm Texas Instruments .
Tan notes that although DRAM factories are closing one after another in the US , patent royalties must still be paid to Texas Instruments for each and every one of the more than 100 million DRAMs produced around the world annually .
This is a classic " knowledge goose that lays golden eggs . "
The new economy is a weapon by which the US dominates the world , with " the export of knowledge " replacing the export of goods .
Yet , in the entire world , only the US , Japan , and the UK export more technology than they import .
In other words , only these three countries have a surplus in " knowledge trade , " and can make money by selling knowledge .
Of these three , US income from selling technology is four times the amount it spends buying technology elsewhere , and it earns enough each year in patent royalties to balance its enormous deficit in manufactured goods .
In contrast , Taiwan is still showing a nasty deficit in knowledge trade , with money going out twice as fast as it is coming in .
The impressive American model would certainly be difficult to apply to the small " shallow " economy in Taiwan .
As Ko Chen-en , dean of the College of Management at National Taiwan University , puts it : " You merely have to ask how many Nobel Prize winners Taiwan has - not many - and you know its real ability to follow the US economic model . "
Ko relates that " high-risk and high-profit " revolutionary new technologies can normally only be created with enormous financial backing .
In 1999 , total expenditures on R-AMP-D in Taiwan by both the government and private sector were a mere NT$ 200 billion -LRB- about US $ 6 billion -RRB- , less than was spent by IBM alone .
Slow improvement
In contrast to the " picking stars from the sky " US model , says Wu Se-hwa , " the European knowledge - based economy concept is closer to what Taiwan needs . "
As Wu explains , the OECD definition of the knowledge - based economy embraces all kinds of industries , from Italian shoes to Dutch flowers .
Any industry that increases its knowledge component , using knowledge to improve management , innovate , or improve quality , can be considered a knowledge industry .
This is a much more practical ambition for Taiwan , which has a high proportion of traditional industry and is extremely dependent on OEM manufacturing to make money .
In 1998 Taiwan had more than 4500 patents approved in the US , ranking fourth .
But not many of these were for original discoveries ; most were in the category of improvements of old ideas , mainly ways to increase efficiency in the manufacturing process .
Innovations that are improvements require less money for R-AMP-D , and do not require genius-like creativity , but can be made primarily by devoting more attention to a specific problem .
S.T. Day , chairman of the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of the ROC , and chairman of the San Sun Hat and Cap Company , takes the following case in point : On most caps there is an " eyelet " in the stitching .
But , because of different machine designs , the gap can be 80 , 90 , or 100 stitches , creating problems for quality control .
San Sun created a computer program that ensures that machines leave a uniform gap of 95 stitches , and even gets the machines to tie a lovely knot when the sticthcing is completed .
This seemingly small improvement actually allows the firm to charge double the unit price per hat .
Day has factories in Taiwan , the US , mainland China , and Dominica .
Wages in Taiwan are 15 times greater than in the PRC , and 100 times greater than in Burma .
" If Taiwan workers just make hats and do nothing else , then it does n't pay .
But if , because of their higher quality , these workers come up with their own ideas for improving the production process , then they are worth it , " says Day with the voice of experience .
He says that in assessing the value of employees , you have to look at more than just the value of the product ; you have to also take into account its " intelligence " value .
San Sun insists it will not lay off any Taiwan workers , nor will it hire foreign laborers in Taiwan , and its sales have not suffered as a result .
Indeed , orders through October of 2000 showed an increase of 60 % over the previous year .
VIA con dios
VIA Technologies , a stock market powerhouse in Taiwan which has made a tremendous impact in the chipset market these past two years , and which is even threatening the dominant position of Intel , has adopted a different strategy for gradually expanding its territory .
William Lee , who works in public relations at VIA , says that the production of chipsets is a high risk activity .
So , taking advantage of the boom in the Taiwan stock market over the past two years , the company went on a binge of hiring , acquisitions , and strategic alliances , expanding in size rapidly .
Lee says that in the past , VIA 's chipsets were designed completely to support Intel specification CPUs .
In 1998 , when Intel insisted on sticking with expensive Rambus memory chips despite a poor market response , VIA saw its opportunity :
It began promoting use of the P133 memory chip , which had been created by an international consortium and was provided to factories free of charge .
For the first time , VIA had challenged the " big boss , " Intel .
In the latter half of 1999 , VIA acquired two CPU companies in the States , giving it an independent ability to develop CPUs .
In addition , half a year ago it entered into cooperation with the US graphics powerhouse S3 to make graphics chips .
In these ways , VIA is moving step by step to enlarge its intellectual holdings .
" You have to have a lot of technology already on hand before you can start talking about systematic integration and trying out major innovations , " says Lee .
It is only now that VIA can escape from the specifications dictated by large multinational firms , and create innovative products of its own .
To meet future market demand for home appliances that are inexpensive , multi-functional , and portable , the main direction will be to get all the functions on to a single chip .
VIA has designed a new 3 - in - 1 chipset which includes CPU , memory , and graphics , which are expected to formally hit the market in the first half of 2001 .
As Lee reveals : " No one has ever done this before .
We are trying something new . "
Save the idiots !
Nonetheless , knowledge and creativity are intangible , and it is not always easy to determine ownership .
This is especially problematic in Taiwan , where some people still do n't have a very clear idea about intellectual property rights , and legal protections are less than comprehensive .
This is a potential problem for the development of the knowledge - based economy in Taiwan .
" Many innovations just represent going a little bit further in thinking about a problem than the other guys , and once the secret is uncovered , it is easy for them to copy the idea , " says Simon Chang .
The most famous example in the industry involves a certain company that wanted to create information systems like storage and document handling .
It invited a number of information industry firms to give briefings on their products .
After a while , this former " outsider " became an insider , and created its own product , congratulating itself on saving so much money in the process .
Simon Chang notes that a major innovation usually is nested in a lot of small innovations .
If small innovations are not recognized , or do not get appropriate market rewards , this will destroy the motivation to innovate at all .
This is precisely the problem now being faced by Comdek , the first company in Taiwan to produce medical instruments such as blood - oxygen monitors and ear thermometers .
Michael Y.S. Kuo , general manager at Comdek , points out that the quick and easy process of taking body temperature through the ear was developed by an American company , and the German giant Boehringer-Ingelheim paid a huge amount of money for the patent so they could begin production .
Comdek took the basic principle , and went to work on it , eventually coming up with their own version , for which they have been awarded a patent .
But when Comdek 's product came out , Michael Kuo still found himself in a vicious struggle with Taiwan pirate firms : " It 's equivalent to making fools out of those of us who invest the money to do research and development ! "
Kuo says that while there has been some improvement in Taiwan with regard to protection of intellectual property rights , there is still not enough for those who invest in development and innovation .
Comdek has closed its laboratory and production line to any outside visits , and has not ruled out the possibility of moving its lab overseas to get away from industrial espionage in Taiwan .
Looking for a Taiwan McDonald 's
Espionage reflects a lack of respect for knowledge .
But there is also the problem of insufficient awareness of the potential value of knowledge , so that , as Wu Se-hwa says , Taiwan firms " are sitting on a mountain of gold , but do n't know that they can sell what they know for hard cash . "
" The most ' classic ' form of knowledge product is one in which the intangible value of the knowledge transcends the tangible value of the product , and can be reproduced in large volume at low cost , thus earning huge profits . "
Wu points to the US coffee shop chain Starbucks .
Can they really make huge profits just by selling cups of coffee for a couple of bucks ?
Of course not .
The headquarters company in fact spends most of its time handling the sale of franchise rights worldwide .
What Starbucks sells is not coffee , but " the knowledge of how to run a coffee shop . "
The same logic applies to McDonalds :
Who does n't know how to draw their " golden arches " trademark ?
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast - food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe .
Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5 % of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .
In recent years , as Taiwan firms have increasingly invested abroad , the " Taiwan experience " has penetrated deeply into Southeast Asia and mainland China .
In both the manufacturing and service sectors , Taiwan businessmen have proven adept at flexibly adapting to local society .
But now that Taiwan methods are well understood and widely copied , Taiwan investors are being dropped by their local partners .
" Taiwan companies do n't understand how to ensure their earnings from management knowledge and company name recognition , and are not in the habit of selling rights or earning royalties , " says Wu with regret , as he offers the following examples : Taiwan department stores are a cut above PRC state - run stores , Taiwan 's construction industry has the knack for systematic management , and even industries like eel - raising have their own technologies and operating methods , but people only think about keeping these secrets to themselves and making money by working on their own .
They do n't know how to spread knowledge so that others will make money for them !
Of course , to sell operational know-how , this knowledge must be converted into steps , systems , and standards , and must be well - packaged .
And trademarks and patents must be employed to deter potential pirates .
Wu suggests that organizations in Taiwan which are dedicated to teaching management methods , such as the China Productivity Center , should assist companies in systematizing and selling the rights to their mangement and operating philosophies , so that the uniquely flexible Taiwan approach to business can be reproduced and marketed worldwide .
" If only people would change their attitudes , the knowledge - based economy could have many new components , and every industry , firm , or individual could find an opportunity to make money on this new frontier , "
concludes Wu .
Looking to the future , the road to a knowledge - based economy is long , but it is the only choice for Taiwan .
What is most important now is to remove obstacles from the path , and to make each stride as large and quick as possible .

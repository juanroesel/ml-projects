Xinhua News Agency , Nanning , January 9th , by reporter Zhicheng Heng
This reporter recently drove to cities such as Guangxi 's Fangchenggang , Qinzhou , Beihai , Zhanjiang , etc. to gather news , and saw that with the opening and operation of the Nanning - Kunming railway , these four port cities along the coast of the Northern Gulf have docks that are anxious and busy with the loading and unloading of cargo , and along the coast , a number of new docks are speedily being constructed .
All over , a thousand sails compete in setting sail , a very lively scene .
Fangchenggang , Qinzhou , Beihai and Zhanjiang , people call the " Dragon 's head " of the southwest 's main passageway to the sea .
The construction of the Nanning - Kunming railway brings unprecedented opportunities for development to the four coastal cities .
The city of Fangchenggang has now developed to become one of the nation 's important pivotal ports , having 20 operating docks , among which 10 have berths above the 10,000 ton level .
Railways and highways directly reach the port .
In 1997 , the port completed cargo throughput of 6.5 million tons , increasing 28 % compared with the previous year .
Among this , southwest provinces and cities ' goods and materials imports and exports increased nearly once over .
At ports such as Zhanjiang , Qinzhou , and Beihai , etc. import and export goods and materials from the great southwest also grew by more than 50 % over the previous year .
Construction of the main passage has activated the flow of materials , the flow of people and the flow of information in the great southwest , and has promoted development in the coastal port cities ' economies .
In order to meet the demands of rapid growth of goods and materials imports and exports in the great southwest , the four coastal cities in the Northern Gulf have started a new upsurge of constructing ports .
The Zhanjiang Port , which was the earliest built and is large - scale , now has 31 operating berths , among which 24 are deep - water berths with a tonnage between 10,000 to 70,000 tons , and has an annual throughput reaching over 18 million tons .
At the Fangchenggang Port , the 10,000 ton level berths , No. 9 and No. 10 , formally began work not long ago .
It was followed by preparing to construct larger berths , No. 11 and No. 12 .
Beihai has now completed four 10,000 ton level docks and in the future another four 10,000 ton level berths will be put into reconstruction .
The Qinzhou Port , which started relatively later , actively introduces a market mechanics to promote the development of the port , organizing big consortia and big companies from home and abroad to establish merchant groups to jointly invite businesses , and introduced an ownership system for reconstructing docks .
Currently , in the port development zone , 19 proprietary ports with tonnage capacities of over 10,000 tons and 14 proprietary storage projects are either under construction or preparing for construction .
After inspections , demonstrations and under the development zone 's uniform planning , proprietors from home and abroad choose their won projects , bring their own capital and sources of goods , manage their own business , and assume responsibility for profits and losses .
China 's first port with proprietors as the main investment bodies will rise from here .
At the same time , the four coastal cities have also actively initiated industrial parks adjacent to the ports .
A number of traveling merchants from home and abroad , especially visionaries coming from the great southwest , have successively come to settle here to start processing industries that import large quantities and export large quantities .
The prospects are extremely good .

Emigrating to Shanghai : A Veteran Shares His Experience
-LRB- Chuang Chih / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
The prospect of emigrating to Shang - hai has caught the imagination of middle - class Taiwanese in recent years , and waves of business persons have been pouring into Shanghai since the early 1990s .
But is that really such a good idea ?
What happens when a Taiwanese expatriate settles in Shanghai ?
Taiwanese businessman Chen Pin , who moved to Shanghai a decade ago , has written of his experiences in Emigrating to Shanghai , which has sold like hotcakes since it was published just last October by Shang Hsun Cultural Publishing Company .
When you think of Shanghai , what comes to mind ?
The grand promenade and European - style buildings along the Bund ?
The bustling shopping district where foreigners congregated in the days of the foreign concessions ?
Du Yuesheng and his notorious Shanghai Green Gang ?
The novels of Eileen Chang ?
Big city , tricky ropes
Chen Pin opened his first business in Shanghai over ten years ago .
In the intervening years he has run a bread factory , restaurants , and a fast food shop .
His son is treated as a PRC citizen , and attends university in Shanghai .
A survivor of many ups and downs himself , Chen gives detailed descriptions of many of the problems faced by Taiwanese business persons in the mainland .
The book describes the property market , cross-strait marriage , starting a business , children 's education , shopping , recreation , and more .
He does not stop at mere description , however .
He also offers suggestions on how to cope with a wide range of difficulties .
This book can serve as a " how to " manual for those who would follow in this footsteps .
Chen offers a lot of very useful insights into the Shanghai property market .
All land is owned by the state , so when you buy a building , you do n't gain outright ownership .
All you get is the right to use it .
Property in Shanghai is divided into various categories , and Chen explains various terms used in the PRC .
" Foreign business buildings " can be purchased by foreign - invested enterprises and persons with a foreign passport .
Buildings sold on the domestic market to PRC firms are called shang pin fang , or literally , " commercial buildings . "
Buildings owned by the state are called gong fang , or " public buildings . "
Buildings owned by private individuals are called si fang , or " private buildings . "
If you 've paid all your property taxes , you are given a da chan zheng , or " big " property certificate .
If you have n't yet paid , you can only get a " small " property certificate , and you ca n't sell your property .
Some buildings can be bought with a loan , but others ca n't .
Newly arrived Taiwanese business persons often make bad judgments if they plunge into the market without studying it carefully first , so Chen suggests the following rules of thumb : The Shanghai property market is in a slump , so there is no need to rush into a purchase .
A buyer must be very clear about the purpose of any property purchase .
It is safest to buy property from the Shanghai Municipal Government , the biggest and most reliable real estate developer in the city .
One must not estimate potential earnings on the basis of experience in Taiwan .
You get more for money when renting than when buying .
You must stand on your rights at all times , and be very careful not to let friends and relatives use their personal ties to take advantage of you .
Secrets to success
When hard - charging Taiwanese businessmen meet up with their smooth - talking Shanghai counterparts , the Taiwanese often come away with the short end of the stick .
From the vendors at open - air markets hawking crabs or pears , to the proprietors of five - star clubs that target a foreign clientele , everyone in Shanghai looks at Taiwanese business persons the same way :
" Oh boy , here comes an easy mark !
Let 's skin him alive ! "
Chen laments , " The old lady at the market sells beans to everybody else at 80 cents per jin , but she jacks up the price on me to two dollars . "
And this is only a cut - and - dried business transaction .
Personal relationships and marriage get a lot more complicated .
Taiwanese men tend to fall like a ton of bricks for the pretty , sweet - talking women in Shanghai , and that signals the beginning of all sorts of problems .
Single men practically shout it out : " My girlfriend is in Shanghai . "
Those who already have wives in Taiwan will tell you in a low whisper : " I 've got a mistress in Shanghai , and I 'm taking care of all her expenses . "
The women of Shanghai are well known for their liberated ways , and it is no simple matter for Taiwanese men there to handle their business and emotional affairs wisely .
Chen argues that allowing direct travel between Taiwan and the mainland would make it much more difficult for Taiwanese men to keep mistresses in the mainland , and would go a long way toward clearing up all the cross-strait marital and romantic problems that now occur so often .
Chen offers several pieces of advice for all who would head for Shanghai , whether alone or with their families .
Shopping :
" You should establish a reputation for being tight - fisted . "
When you buy things , pretend not to have as much money as they 're demanding .
Ask questions , and keep asking until you get clear answers before you pay anybody any money .
Also , keeping a low profile is a means of self - defense .
You should be careful not to flaunt knowledge or ability .
General attitude :
" The Taiwanese are considered uncultured boors in spite of their wealth .
Live down that image .
Be humble .
Get to know the daily lives of people in Shanghai . "
Looking out for No. 1 :
" You must understand that undercurrents in Shanghai are strong .
It 's hard to stay afloat , and many people enjoy watching your struggle ; they 're hoping you 'll go under .
You have to understand the legal systems and government policies .
You have to know how to operate under the table .
Markets change overnight , and personal relationships are ambiguous .
Trust no one , for no one is looking to save you a penny or help you earn a bit extra .
You 're on your own . "
You 're not in Taiwan anymore
In both emotional and historical terms , Shanghai seems very near , but in fact it is a very unfamiliar place .
Our dreams , yearnings , and imaginings blind us to the truth , and this especially true of Taiwanese business persons .
The book 's subtitle , A Meeting of " the Taiwanese Experience " and Shanghai Style , hints at the conflicts inherent in the relationship .
Although the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait share a common language and ethnicity , our long separation has given rise to sharply divergent values and ways of thinking .
When someone from Shanghai says , " This is n't a big problem , " you have to realize that he has just acknowledged that there 's a problem , and it 's up to you to figure out how serious it really is .
Taiwanese ways do n't fly in Shanghai .
Do you want to eat the famous steamed mantou buns at Nanxiang Restaurant ?
Shop for antiques ?
Visit Zhouzhuang , the so - called " Venice of the Orient " ?
Before you take off , do your homework .
Shanghai is a big city , after all , and there are plenty of " crouching dragons and hidden tigers " lurking in the shadows .

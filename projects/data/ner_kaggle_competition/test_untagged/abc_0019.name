Back to the Middle East tonight .
the truce brokered by President Clinton between Israelis and Palestinians allegedly is in tatters .
Palestinians now talking about a battle for independence .
Israel says it may abandon the peace negotiations altogether .
Nine Palestinians were killed today .
More than 70 people have been wounded , mostly Palestinians , but also several Israeli soldiers .
ABC 's Bob Woodruff is in the Palestinian territories tonight .
Violence ripped through almost every major Palestinian town today .
The worst was in Nablus .
Four Palestinians were shot and killed .
In Ramallah , thousands of Palestinians rushed the Israeli checkpoint , then faced down Israeli guns .
From Hebron to Gaza , the wounded were carried off so fast it was difficult to count them .
As is so often the case , much of the trouble started with funerals that escalated into fury .
Most significant , demonstrators who had been throwing stones this week , today turned to gasoline bombs .
Israelis who had been firing rubber bullets stepped up their use of real ones .
This was supposed to be the day the truce went into effect , when both sides would call off the violence , but that clearly has not happened , and here in the streets , peace seems very unlikely .
Tonight on Israeli television , Prime Minister Barak said we can not go on as if nothing happened , and if the demonstrations do n't stop , Barak 's spokesman said Israel will continue to use live ammunition .
They leave no other way for us but to respond with fire , we 'll have to do this .
Palestinian leaders said their people no longer want a cease - fire , they want their own country .
We are under occupation and subjugation .
The question should be what the Hosni Mubarak are they still doing there eight years after the peace process began .
It is one of the major questions that was supposed to be addressed after the stoning and shooting had stopped .
It certainly has not stopped .
Not yet .

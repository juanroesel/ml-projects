Parliament Member Mishaan Al - Jubouri , Head of the Reconciliation and Liberation Block , said that the political process has died and should be buried .
This came in an interview with one of the satellite channels .
He also described the current and previous governments as sectarian and exclusive governments that kill Sunnis and assist the militias in doing so .
He also described Al - Maliki as the most exclusive person , whose motto is murder , then murder , then murder , and he was responsible for the military office of the Shiite Dawa party , which is killing Sunnis .
He noted that Al - Maliki had told him , " Let the Sunnis go as refugees outside the country for 30 years and then let them come for us to reconcile with them . "
As for the reconciliation project that Al - Maliki has announced , Mishaan said this project has no basis in fact and that what Al - Maliki did was only to satisfy the Americans and trick certain politicians , and that his establishment of the Anbar Militias , who strive to kill the people of Anbar , is nothing but proof of this .
Mishaan Al - Jubouri accused Moqtada Al Sadr and his Mahdi Army militia of killing Sunnis and of being behind the Sadr city explosions , with help from an outside party , in reference to Iran .
He said that there was a committee of lawmakers in Brussels that was gathering evidence on the crimes of Moqtada Al Sadr and his militias .
It is worth noting that Mishaan Al - Jubouri 's immunity was withdrawn due to accusations of corruption from the Government Integrity Committee , and that the Reconciliation and Liberation Party which he chairs had withdrawn from the government .

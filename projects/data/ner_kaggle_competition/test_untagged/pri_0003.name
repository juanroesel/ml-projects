A Moscow summit on Yugoslavia may be some way off as President Putin has arrived in India for a four - day visit .
Russia 's relationship with India has wilted to some extent in recent years and after President Clinton 's visit to India in March , the emphasis has been more on developing ties between Delhi and Washington .
Michael Ridge reports .
There has been no visit by a Russian leader to India for nearly eight years , but Mr. Putin has been emphasizing before this visit that it did n't mean Moscow had abandoned india .
Mr. Putin has said he wants to see Russia and India pool their efforts on combating international terrorism and pullegisic extremism .
India will be keen to do the same and the area of mutual interests as expected to be discussed this week is Afghanistan and the extent of Taliban 's influence in central Asia and in Kashmir .

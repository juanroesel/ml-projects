A month ago , I was really desperate , I lost my current job , which I was completely unprepared for , and had to find a job within a month to keep myself going .
Now in this month with the Christmas holiday there 's really only three weeks of actual work time , and I do n't think any companies are going to be hiring people during this period .
Despair , that sinking feeling weighing on my mind , so much pressure I could n't eat , could n't sleep ; I was simply going crazy .
But I still needed to do something ; getting crazy - hysteric makes no sense .
Then I started connecting with my friends in America ; I went to Maimaiti to ask for help , consulted about my status , and looked for a way to solve the problem .
Even my relatives ' friends in America and my parents ' friends all got involved .
Friends , it 's always friends who help me at key moments .
Many friends got people they knew to recommend me , help me send out resumes , or call and commiserate with me .
There was one friend who had just got an offer , but he did n't want to go , so he recommended me to go for him , but it was way off in LA , plus the salary was n't ideal , but at least it could help me keep the legal status , so I thought I would take it .
After the telephone interview , I flew to LA , landing at 12:00 noon , and at 4:00 p.m. .
I had the interview .
By then 17 - 18 hours had passed since I 'd gotten up at 4:00 a.m.
Although I was too tired to walk , I still had to pump up my spirits so I 'd be in peak form for the interview .
The interview did n't last long , just two hours and it was over .
I felt the interview went well , and started to feel confident .
But on that day one senior level person was n't there , so the next day early I had to go back to talk to him .
So the next day I got up at 7:00 and ran over to chat for an hour ; that guy was nice , did n't embarrass me , so after an hour it ended happily .
After that the boss took me to the home office , and on the way he gave me an oral offer , and he said it would not be easy for me to come right away , that I should do the physical exam immediately and do all the paperwork , wait until after New Year 's , and the HR director would return and turn in the H1 .
Then I went straight for the physical , and I filled out the application form , reference list , etc.
At 3:00 p.m. , the dust finally settled .
Finally before Christmas I received a Christmas present .
Although I still have n't made the final decision to go , at least I have a guaranteed - minimum choice .
So I am thanking everyone for helping me .
I hope that all my friends who are still looking for work will be able to find their ideal job in the New Year .

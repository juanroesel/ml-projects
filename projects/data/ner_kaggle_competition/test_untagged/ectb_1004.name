James Soong Gets a Message :
Show Us the Money !
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
In December there was an unexpected shock in the presidential election race .
The shock did not come from the announcement on the 10th by Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui - bian that his running mate would be Annette Lu -LRB- this was expected -RRB- , but rather from revelations about mystery funds which embroiled independent candidate James Soong .
Soong , who had been far ahead in public opinion polls , has suffered a severe blow from the so - called " Chung Hsing Case , " and his support has dropped markedly , so that now Chen and Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan are running neck - and - neck with him .
Indeed , the aftershocks of the case have not subsided .
On December 22 , Minister of Finance Paul Chiu , responding to interpellations in the Legislative Yuan , officially announced some findings of the investigation into major securities trading by Soong Chen - yuan , the son of James Soong .
Most important were revelations about accounts held in the names of Soong family members .
Legislator Yang Chi - hsiung had uncovered two funds , valued at NT$ 140 million and $ 470 million , under the names of Soong Chen - yuan and James Soong 's sister - in - law Chen Pi - yun .
In addition , said Minister Chiu , there were other accounts , the largest of which reached as high as NT$ 300 million in value .
The Taipei District Prosecutor 's Office then opened its own investigation .
It collected evidence from the Ministry of Finance , the Bank of Taiwan , Chung Hsing Bills Finance , and other institutions .
After tracing the flow of money , it then called in Chen Pi - yun and Soong Chen - yuan for questioning .
Faced with outside scepticism , James Soong then asked New Party legislator Hsieh Chi - ta to form an audit team and investigate .
On December 28 , Hsieh held a press conference to relate the results of the audit , in which he explained when the accounts were opened , how they were used , and what the flow of the money was .
At the press conference , Chen Pi - yun stated that there was nearly NT$ 1 billion from several sources , including more than NT$ 400 million left over from funds collected for Soong 's campaign for provincial governor -LRB- which , according to the law , Soong could retain -RRB- , NT$ 300 million provided by the provincial water conservancy authorities for a fund to train water conservancy specialists , more than NT$ 140 million in funds provided by the KMT for " party operations , " more than NT$ 100 million for the purpose of looking after the descendants of the late president Chiang Ching - kuo , and more than NT$ 14 million in family savings .
The funds were used , according to Hsieh 's audit , to support election campaigns of provincial assemblymen , to support the election campaign of current president Lee Teng - hui , to pay business expenses for James Soong , to establish a scholarship fund for students to go the University of California at Berkeley , and to support Soong Chen - yuan in his studies and business activities in the US .
A final version of Hsieh 's findings is to be provided to the investigating authorities .
However , Chen Pi - yun provided no reasonable explanation of the key question : Why were public funds mixed up with and deposited along with private funds in the Soong family 's private accounts ?
Soong , who participated in Hsieh 's press conference , then declared that the mixing of public and private funds was done on the orders of party chairman Lee Teng - hui for purposes of " security , reliability , secrecy , and avoiding trouble . "
After the Hsieh - Chen - Soong press conference , the KMT held its own .
Party spokesperson Huang Hui - chen said that the KMT had never officially authorized Soong to have or use these funds , and that Soong was suspected of embezzlement .
A judicial investigation will be required to look into this .
So how did all this start ?
On December 9 legislator Yang Chi - hsiung held a press conference at which he stated that Soong Chen - yuan had opened a securities trading account at Chung Hsing Bills Finance , that in December of 1992 , Soong Chen - yuan purchased NT$ 106 million in securities , and that as of the date of the press conference , there was more than NT$ 140 million in securities in the account .
Yang wondered how Soong Chen - yuan , who had just graduated from university , could possess such a large amount of wealth .
James Soong thereafter stated that after his son had gone abroad to study and start a business , a benevolent " elder " opened an account which would allow the younger Soong to withdraw funds from the interest as needed .
Over the years , there was no special need for the money , and last June NT$ 140 million was returned .
As for who this " elder " is , Soong would not say .
But scepticism persisted .
On December 15 , Soong held a press conference at which he stated that the account in his son 's name was set up under the direction of KMT party chairman Lee Teng - hui .
He said that NT$ 146,460,000 was transferred from the special account of the KMT Secretary - General and deposited in accounts under the names of Soong Chen - yuan and Chen Pi - yun .
The money was designated , said Soong , to take care of the descendants of former president Chiang Ching - kuo , and for " party tasks " specially designated by the chairman .
Soong said that the amounts announced by Yang were inaccurate .
Soong held a second press conference on December 18 .
This time he declared only that the money had been intended for looking after the Chiang family .
On December 21 , Legislator Yang held his third press conference , in which he stated that Soong 's sister - in - law , Chen Pi - yun , had , in a half - month period at the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995 , used NT$ 470 million in cash to purchase bonds and securities at Chung Hsing .
Under pressure from the public and legislators , on December 22 Minister of Finance Chiu announced partial results of their investigation , as mentioned above .
This in turn sparked Soong to ask Hsieh Chi - ta for another audit .
There have been no firm conclusions as yet .
The Chung Hsing case may or may not be fully clarified , but it has certainly greatly affected James Soong 's public support .
Before the scandal broke , he was getting more than 30 % support in public opinion polls , but a December 20 poll by the China Times shows Soong with only 23 % .
This leaves him behind Chen Shui - bian -LRB- 24 % -RRB- and barely ahead of Lien Chan -LRB- 22 % -RRB- .
Yet , while Soong 's support has fallen , that of Chen and Lien has not markedly increased .
Obviously former Soong supporters are now taking a wait - and - see attitude .
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC .
Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention .
There 's little discussion of public policy .
For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui - bian .
What is wrong with Taiwan 's democratic culture ?
Do the public and media need to reassess ?
After all , in the new millennium , there will be many more tests facing us .

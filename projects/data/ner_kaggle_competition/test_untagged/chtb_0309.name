The China 's handicapped sports cause has undergone the several stages of conceptualization , growth and expansion , and is currently rising .
The holding of the 6th Far East and South Pacific Disabled Games will provide more impetus for this trend .
Each development step of handicapped sports can not be separated from the concern and support of the Party and the government .
At the beginning of the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , social welfare services and schools for blind children and deaf people were established successively everywhere .
Welfare factories developed activities such as broadcast exercises , etc. and schools established physical education .
As a part of the cause for the disabled , disabled sports began to grow .
Every year , the nation allocates special funds to be used in developing handicapped sports activities .
Nationwide handicapped sports games began to be held in the late 1950's .
The games accelerated improvement and drove popularization .
The handicapped sports cause has gradually grown .
Since the reform and opening up , the Chinese economy has developed rapidly .
This enabled more people to put money and material resource into the disabled sports cause .
In the short 10 years , the cause has achieved success of attention from China and abroad .
It is reasonable to believe that the disabled cause will be increasingly recognized and supported as China 's overall national strength escalates .
The handicapped sports cause will also have broad development .
The establishment and healthiness of disabled sports organizations provide organizational assurance for the development of the sports cause for handicapped people .
The Chinese Injured and Disabled People Sports Association -LRB- renamed to the Chinese Disabled Sports Association in 1990 -RRB- was established in October , 1983 .
After this a succession of handicapped sports organizations were established throughout China .
In 1985 , the Chinese Mentally Impaired and Blind Sports Associations were also established .
Having organization and leadership , activities such as the games and competitions , etc. were increasingly and frequently held .
The enthusiasm of handicapped people participating in the sports activities was unprecedentedly increasing , sports levels continually improve and the reserve force is growing .
Three National Disabled Games were held respectively in Hefei , Tangshan and Guangzhou .
The scale became larger and larger and the level became higher and higher .
The games have received more broad attention and support of the public , and have attracted more disabled people to take part in the events .
Since 1984 the Chinese Disabled Sports Association has become a member of 8 international disabled sports organizations successively , such as the International Para Olympic Committee , etc. and has established relations with disabled sports organizations in various countries and areas and taken part in international events such as the Special Olympic Games , etc .
In competitions and contacts , disabled Chinese people have revealed extraordinary physical abilities , achieved excellent results , enhanced friendship with disabled people from various countries and areas and contributed to the development of physical activities for disabled people around the world .
" The Guaranteed Law for Disabled Persons in the People 's Republic of China " , which was drafted and implemented in 1991 , stipulates to organize and support disabled people to develop mass sports activities , to hold special games and to participate in important international competitions and communication .
The guarantee of the law has and will continue to boost the vigorous development of the sports cause for China 's disabled .
Holding the 6th Asia - Pacific Special Olympic Games in Beijing will motivate all of society to better understand and support disabled sports .
It will make the public more conscious of helping disabled people and encourage more disabled people to take part in physical activities .
It will , therefore , greatly assist in the development of the sports cause for China 's disabled .
Truly , the foundation of disabled sports in China is not very strong , popularization is not yet widespread , and compared with some developed countries , still has a large gap .
However , the " impact " of the Far South Games foreshadows a bright future for this civilized and progressive cause .

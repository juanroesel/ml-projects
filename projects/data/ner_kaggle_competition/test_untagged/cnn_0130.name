A return to Soviet - era symbolism in Russia is gaining favor .
The Duma , the lower house of the Russian parliament , has voted to adopt the old Soviet national anthem as the new Russian anthem .
The song now in use was introduced in 1993 .
The issue sparked demonstrations , pitting supporters against those who fiercely oppose a connection with what they consider a murderous regime .
The Upper House must next approve the measure .
President Vladimir Putin has pledged his support , but has called for different lyrics .

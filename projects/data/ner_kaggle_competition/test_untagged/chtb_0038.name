Xinhua News Agency , Zhengzhou , April 18 , by wire -LRB- reporters Xianwen Guo and Geng Wang
The second construction phase of the Anyang Color Kinescope Glass - Shell Co. , Ltd. , designed and built using Chinese initiative , and meeting current world - wide advanced technological levels , today finished construction and started operations .
The Vice Premier of the State Council , Jiahua Zou , attended the ribbon cutting ceremony held today for the start of operations .
According to the introduction , the completion of construction and startup of operations of Anbo 's second project phase enabled Anbo Co. 's yearly production capacity of colored glass - shells to expand from the six million cases of the first phase up to eleven million cases , turning it into China 's largest production base for colored glass - shells in terms of current scale of production .
After the start of operations , it was then able to produce the complete set of color kinescope glass - shells for color TVs and was also able to produce the complete set of color kinescope glass - shells for computer monitors .
The specifications go from 35 cm straight up to 84 cm .
It simultaneously laid a foundation for the next step of independently developing and producing high clarity glass - shells and wide - screen color TV glass - shells .
The Anbo company is a key project in China 's nationalization of the production of color TVs , which China built up during the " seventh five - year plan " period -LRB- 1986 - 1990 -RRB- with wholesale introduction of foreign advanced technology and implementation of general technological contracts from outside .
Since it started production in 1991 , altogether it has completed close to 1,000 technological improvements and development projects and has independently developed more than 20 new products and new types of products , including large - screen color TV glass - shells .
Yearly output exceeded designed capability by 78 % , last year already attaining 7.12 million cases .
The share of the domestic market of the products and the percent coverage of the kinds of products reached 70 % and 90 % , respectively .
At the same time it resold to Japan and exported to countries like Korea and India .
Since starting production , cumulatively it has realized composite economic benefits of 1.06 billion yuan and earned 48.56 million US dollars through exports and remittances , which is enough to recoup the total fixed investment of the first project phase .
To accelerate the establishment and development of the colored glass industry of China 's nationalities , the people of Anbo , in the construction of the second project phase , boldly adopted the completely new ways of thinking of " being one 's own master , widely adopting the strong points of the people , having a unique style , individually creating a system " and of " general contracting one 's own skills , from a high starting point optimizing the two types of resources , international and domestic " and attained the approval of the leadership of the State Council and the vigorous support of the relevant national departments .
They worked many wonders that attracted the widespread attention of those in the same business inside and outside the country .
Number one was the fact that it took only thirteen months from November 18 , 1994 , when ground was broken and construction started , up until the drill - furnace fire lighting was successful .
Compared to Anbo 's first phase the time period for the project was shortened by eighteen months , and compared to the fastest construction globally for comparable projects , it still was 5 months in advance .
Two was bringing about the optimum combination of resources such as domestic and foreign trained personnel , skills , equipment , design and construction , etc .
No matter what the hardware deployment or the software usage , everything met the current advanced standards for its industry internationally .
Three , compared with a wholesale introduction of foreign techniques and equipment , investment was greatly economized .
According to measurements and calculations , the actual investment in Anbo 's second project phase only amounted to one - half of what the total investment would be for a comparable project that at present domestically would be built using a wholesale introduction of foreign techniques and equipment .
